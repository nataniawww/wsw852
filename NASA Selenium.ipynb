In the Arctic, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in Arctic research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the Arctic. Recent trends in Arctic surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and Arctic glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the Arctic Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent Arctic change and provide a context for future scenarios. We further quantify uncertainties in key reanalyses variables and approaches for addressing these issues.Document ID 20190031804 Document Type Poster Authors Andrews, Lauren C.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.Document ID 20140008934 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011JC007257Authors Johnson, Mark (Alaska Univ.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.Document ID 20230001741 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors I.V.

Technical Review External Peer Committee KeywordsWildfireArcticRussiaClimate changeAdaptationSystematic reviewcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsReviews and syntheses: Arctic fire regimes and emissions in the 21st centuryIn recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.Document ID 20210021735 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplementAuthors Jessica L.

Technical Review External Peer Committee KeywordsArcticnorthern high latitudesFire RegimesWIldfireEmissionsBorealcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsArctic Amplification Response to Individual Climate DriversThe Arctic is experiencing rapid climate change in response to changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols and other climate drivers. Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.Document ID 20190027361 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Camilla Weum Stjern (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Marianne Tronstad Lund (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Bjorn Hallvard Samset (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Gunnar Myhre (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Piers M Forster  (University of Leeds Leeds, United Kingdom)Et alDate Acquired July 17, 2019 Publication Date June 10, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 124 Issue: 13 ISSN: 2169-897X URL: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029726?af=R DOI: doi:10.1029/2018JD029726Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN69756Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/N006038/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 229771 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC nn2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K500872/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15K12190 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15H01728 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC ns2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 207711/E10 CONTRACT_GRANT: UK BEIZ/DMOHCCP GA01101 CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K007483/1Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.Document ID 20170011215 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.Document ID 20205007200 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-9yp5-6p27Authors Cheng Zheng (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Yutian Wu (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Mingfang Ting (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Clara Orbe (Goddard Institute for Space Studies New York, New York, United States) Xinyue Wang (National Center for Atmospheric Research Boulder, Colorado, United States)Et alDate Acquired September 3, 2020 Publication Date February 1, 2021 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 126 Issue: 4 ISSN: 2169-897X DOI: 10.1029/2020JD033811Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.31.04.14  CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF OPP‐1825858 CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF AGS‐1802248Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.Document ID 20170012176 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

Keywords Surface TemperaturArcticcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsProcess drivers, inter-model spread, and a path forward: What do we know about Arctic Amplification?Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the Arctic resulting from enhanced surface warming in the Arctic relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called Arctic Amplification. While surface-based amplification of Arctic warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to Arctic Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in Arctic Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving Arctic Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected Arctic climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the Arctic lapse rate feedback.Document ID 20205010055 Document Type Presentation Authors Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.Document ID 20210011823 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Eric Stofferahn (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Joshua B Fisher (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Daniel J Hayes (University of Maine Orono, Maine, United States) Christopher R Schwalm (Woods Hole Research Center Falmouth, Massachusetts, United States) Deborah N Huntzinger (Northern Arizona University Flagstaff, Arizona, United States)Et alDate Acquired March 23, 2021 Publication Date May 1, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Environmental Research Letters Volume: 14 Issue: 5 DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/ab10faSubject CategoryEarth Resources And Remote SensingFunding Number(s) WBS: 304029.01.20.04.01.02 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC19M0113 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NM0018D0004P00002 CONTRACT_GRANT: GBMF5439 CONTRACT_GRANT: DOE-ERKP818Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.Document ID 20190001702 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Ivy Tan (University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, Maryland, United States) Trude Storelvmo (University of Oslo Oslo, Oslo, Norway)Date Acquired March 20, 2019 Publication Date February 25, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 46 Issue: 5 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081871Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN66580Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NNX15AT34A CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF-1352417Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.Document ID 20140017663 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014Authors Jiao, C.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the Arctic Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of Arctic Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.Document ID 20140006607 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011GL050052Authors Farrell, Sinead Louise (Maryland Univ.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.Document ID 20160000353 Document Type Presentation Authors Orbe, Clara (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Newman, Paul A.

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of Arctic stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the Arctic using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the Arctic between 1995 and 2015.Document ID 20205004491 Document Type Presentation Authors U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.Document ID 20220009666 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2021GL097373&file=2021GL097373-sup-0001-Supporting+Information+SI-S01.pdfAuthors Ivy Tran (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Donifan Barahona (Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland, United States) Quentin Coopman (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada)Date Acquired June 22, 2022 Publication Date January 31, 2022 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 49 Issue: 4 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: 10.1029/2021GL097373Subject CategoryGeophysicsFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.04.03.28 CONTRACT_GRANT: NASA  80NSSC18K1599Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\n\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.Document ID 20160003310 Document Type Presentation Authors Zamora, Lauren  (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Kahn, R.

SynthesisReanalyses are regularly gridded, retrospective depictions of the physical earth system, which are produced through the correction of a short-term forecast to available observations. In the Arctic, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in Arctic research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the Arctic. Recent trends in Arctic surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and Arctic glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the Arctic Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent Arctic change and provide a context for future scenarios. We further quantify uncertainties in key reanalyses variables and approaches for addressing these issues.Document ID 20190031804 Document Type Poster Authors Andrews, Lauren C.

Technical Review NASA Technical Management KeywordsArcticMERRA-2cloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsEvaluation of Arctic Sea Ice Thickness Simulated by Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project ModelsSix Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project model simulations are compared with estimates of sea ice thickness derived from pan-Arctic satellite freeboard measurements (2004-2008); airborne electromagnetic measurements (2001-2009); ice draft data from moored instruments in Fram Strait, the Greenland Sea, and the Beaufort Sea (1992-2008) and from submarines (1975-2000); and drill hole data from the Arctic basin, Laptev, and East Siberian marginal seas (1982-1986) and coastal stations (1998-2009). Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.Document ID 20140008934 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011JC007257Authors Johnson, Mark (Alaska Univ.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.Document ID 20230001741 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors I.V.

Technical Review External Peer Committee KeywordsWildfireArcticRussiaClimate changeAdaptationSystematic reviewcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsReviews and syntheses: Arctic fire regimes and emissions in the 21st centuryIn recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.Document ID 20210021735 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplementAuthors Jessica L.

Technical Review External Peer Committee KeywordsArcticnorthern high latitudesFire RegimesWIldfireEmissionsBorealcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsArctic Amplification Response to Individual Climate DriversThe Arctic is experiencing rapid climate change in response to changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols and other climate drivers. Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.Document ID 20190027361 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Camilla Weum Stjern (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Marianne Tronstad Lund (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Bjorn Hallvard Samset (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Gunnar Myhre (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Piers M Forster  (University of Leeds Leeds, United Kingdom)Et alDate Acquired July 17, 2019 Publication Date June 10, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 124 Issue: 13 ISSN: 2169-897X URL: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029726?af=R DOI: doi:10.1029/2018JD029726Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN69756Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/N006038/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 229771 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC nn2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K500872/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15K12190 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15H01728 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC ns2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 207711/E10 CONTRACT_GRANT: UK BEIZ/DMOHCCP GA01101 CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K007483/1Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.Document ID 20170011215 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

Keywords Sea IcArctic Oceancloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsSummertime Transport Pathways from Different Northern Hemisphere Regions into the ArcticTrace gases and aerosols play an important role in Arctic chemistry and climate. As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.Document ID 20205007200 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-9yp5-6p27Authors Cheng Zheng (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Yutian Wu (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Mingfang Ting (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Clara Orbe (Goddard Institute for Space Studies New York, New York, United States) Xinyue Wang (National Center for Atmospheric Research Boulder, Colorado, United States)Et alDate Acquired September 3, 2020 Publication Date February 1, 2021 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 126 Issue: 4 ISSN: 2169-897X DOI: 10.1029/2020JD033811Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.31.04.14  CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF OPP‐1825858 CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF AGS‐1802248Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.Document ID 20170012176 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

Keywords Surface TemperaturArcticcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsProcess drivers, inter-model spread, and a path forward: What do we know about Arctic Amplification?Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the Arctic resulting from enhanced surface warming in the Arctic relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called Arctic Amplification. While surface-based amplification of Arctic warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to Arctic Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in Arctic Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving Arctic Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected Arctic climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the Arctic lapse rate feedback.Document ID 20205010055 Document Type Presentation Authors Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.Document ID 20210011823 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Eric Stofferahn (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Joshua B Fisher (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Daniel J Hayes (University of Maine Orono, Maine, United States) Christopher R Schwalm (Woods Hole Research Center Falmouth, Massachusetts, United States) Deborah N Huntzinger (Northern Arizona University Flagstaff, Arizona, United States)Et alDate Acquired March 23, 2021 Publication Date May 1, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Environmental Research Letters Volume: 14 Issue: 5 DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/ab10faSubject CategoryEarth Resources And Remote SensingFunding Number(s) WBS: 304029.01.20.04.01.02 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC19M0113 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NM0018D0004P00002 CONTRACT_GRANT: GBMF5439 CONTRACT_GRANT: DOE-ERKP818Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.Document ID 20190001702 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Ivy Tan (University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, Maryland, United States) Trude Storelvmo (University of Oslo Oslo, Oslo, Norway)Date Acquired March 20, 2019 Publication Date February 25, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 46 Issue: 5 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081871Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN66580Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NNX15AT34A CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF-1352417Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.Document ID 20140017663 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014Authors Jiao, C.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the Arctic Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of Arctic Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.Document ID 20140006607 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011GL050052Authors Farrell, Sinead Louise (Maryland Univ.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.Document ID 20160000353 Document Type Presentation Authors Orbe, Clara (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Newman, Paul A.

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of Arctic stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the Arctic using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the Arctic between 1995 and 2015.Document ID 20205004491 Document Type Presentation Authors U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.Document ID 20220009666 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2021GL097373&file=2021GL097373-sup-0001-Supporting+Information+SI-S01.pdfAuthors Ivy Tran (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Donifan Barahona (Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland, United States) Quentin Coopman (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada)Date Acquired June 22, 2022 Publication Date January 31, 2022 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 49 Issue: 4 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: 10.1029/2021GL097373Subject CategoryGeophysicsFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.04.03.28 CONTRACT_GRANT: NASA  80NSSC18K1599Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\n\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.Document ID 20160003310 Document Type Presentation Authors Zamora, Lauren  (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Kahn, R.

In the Arctic, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in Arctic research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the Arctic. Recent trends in Arctic surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and Arctic glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the Arctic Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent Arctic change and provide a context for future scenarios. We further quantify uncertainties in key reanalyses variables and approaches for addressing these issues.Document ID 20190031804 Document Type Poster Authors Andrews, Lauren C.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.Document ID 20140008934 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011JC007257Authors Johnson, Mark (Alaska Univ.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.Document ID 20230001741 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors I.V.

Technical Review External Peer Committee KeywordsWildfireArcticRussiaClimate changeAdaptationSystematic reviewcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsReviews and syntheses: Arctic fire regimes and emissions in the 21st centuryIn recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.Document ID 20210021735 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplementAuthors Jessica L.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.Document ID 20190027361 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Camilla Weum Stjern (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Marianne Tronstad Lund (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Bjorn Hallvard Samset (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Gunnar Myhre (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Piers M Forster  (University of Leeds Leeds, United Kingdom)Et alDate Acquired July 17, 2019 Publication Date June 10, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 124 Issue: 13 ISSN: 2169-897X URL: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029726?af=R DOI: doi:10.1029/2018JD029726Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN69756Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/N006038/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 229771 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC nn2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K500872/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15K12190 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15H01728 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC ns2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 207711/E10 CONTRACT_GRANT: UK BEIZ/DMOHCCP GA01101 CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K007483/1Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.Document ID 20170011215 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.Document ID 20205007200 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-9yp5-6p27Authors Cheng Zheng (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Yutian Wu (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Mingfang Ting (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Clara Orbe (Goddard Institute for Space Studies New York, New York, United States) Xinyue Wang (National Center for Atmospheric Research Boulder, Colorado, United States)Et alDate Acquired September 3, 2020 Publication Date February 1, 2021 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 126 Issue: 4 ISSN: 2169-897X DOI: 10.1029/2020JD033811Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.31.04.14  CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF OPP‐1825858 CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF AGS‐1802248Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.Document ID 20170012176 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

Keywords Surface TemperaturArcticcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsProcess drivers, inter-model spread, and a path forward: What do we know about Arctic Amplification?Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the Arctic resulting from enhanced surface warming in the Arctic relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called Arctic Amplification. While surface-based amplification of Arctic warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to Arctic Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in Arctic Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving Arctic Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected Arctic climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the Arctic lapse rate feedback.Document ID 20205010055 Document Type Presentation Authors Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.Document ID 20210011823 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Eric Stofferahn (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Joshua B Fisher (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Daniel J Hayes (University of Maine Orono, Maine, United States) Christopher R Schwalm (Woods Hole Research Center Falmouth, Massachusetts, United States) Deborah N Huntzinger (Northern Arizona University Flagstaff, Arizona, United States)Et alDate Acquired March 23, 2021 Publication Date May 1, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Environmental Research Letters Volume: 14 Issue: 5 DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/ab10faSubject CategoryEarth Resources And Remote SensingFunding Number(s) WBS: 304029.01.20.04.01.02 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC19M0113 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NM0018D0004P00002 CONTRACT_GRANT: GBMF5439 CONTRACT_GRANT: DOE-ERKP818Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.Document ID 20190001702 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Ivy Tan (University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, Maryland, United States) Trude Storelvmo (University of Oslo Oslo, Oslo, Norway)Date Acquired March 20, 2019 Publication Date February 25, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 46 Issue: 5 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081871Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN66580Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NNX15AT34A CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF-1352417Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.Document ID 20140017663 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014Authors Jiao, C.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the Arctic Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of Arctic Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.Document ID 20140006607 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011GL050052Authors Farrell, Sinead Louise (Maryland Univ.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.Document ID 20160000353 Document Type Presentation Authors Orbe, Clara (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Newman, Paul A.

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of Arctic stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the Arctic using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the Arctic between 1995 and 2015.Document ID 20205004491 Document Type Presentation Authors U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.Document ID 20220009666 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2021GL097373&file=2021GL097373-sup-0001-Supporting+Information+SI-S01.pdfAuthors Ivy Tran (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Donifan Barahona (Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland, United States) Quentin Coopman (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada)Date Acquired June 22, 2022 Publication Date January 31, 2022 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 49 Issue: 4 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: 10.1029/2021GL097373Subject CategoryGeophysicsFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.04.03.28 CONTRACT_GRANT: NASA  80NSSC18K1599Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

CARVE bridges critical gaps in our knowledge and understanding of Arctic ecosystems, linkages between the Arctic hydrologic and terrestrial carbon cycles, and the feedbacks from fires and thawing permafrost. CARVE's objectives are to: (1) Directly test hypotheses attributing the mobilization of vulnerable Arctic carbon reservoirs to climate warming; (2) Deliver the first direct measurements and detailed maps of CO2 and CH4 sources on regional scales in the Alaskan Arctic; and (3) Demonstrate new remote sensing and modeling capabilities to quantify feedbacks between carbon fluxes and carbon cycle-climate processes in the Arctic (Figure 1).

Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\n\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.Document ID 20160003310 Document Type Presentation Authors Zamora, Lauren  (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Kahn, R.

In the Arctic, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in Arctic research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the Arctic. Recent trends in Arctic surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and Arctic glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the Arctic Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent Arctic change and provide a context for future scenarios. We further quantify uncertainties in key reanalyses variables and approaches for addressing these issues.Document ID 20190031804 Document Type Poster Authors Andrews, Lauren C.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.Document ID 20140008934 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011JC007257Authors Johnson, Mark (Alaska Univ.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.Document ID 20230001741 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors I.V.

Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.Document ID 20210021735 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplementAuthors Jessica L.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.Document ID 20190027361 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Camilla Weum Stjern (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Marianne Tronstad Lund (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Bjorn Hallvard Samset (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Gunnar Myhre (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Piers M Forster  (University of Leeds Leeds, United Kingdom)Et alDate Acquired July 17, 2019 Publication Date June 10, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 124 Issue: 13 ISSN: 2169-897X URL: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029726?af=R DOI: doi:10.1029/2018JD029726Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN69756Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/N006038/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 229771 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC nn2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K500872/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15K12190 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15H01728 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC ns2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 207711/E10 CONTRACT_GRANT: UK BEIZ/DMOHCCP GA01101 CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K007483/1Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.Document ID 20170011215 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.Document ID 20205007200 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-9yp5-6p27Authors Cheng Zheng (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Yutian Wu (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Mingfang Ting (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Clara Orbe (Goddard Institute for Space Studies New York, New York, United States) Xinyue Wang (National Center for Atmospheric Research Boulder, Colorado, United States)Et alDate Acquired September 3, 2020 Publication Date February 1, 2021 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 126 Issue: 4 ISSN: 2169-897X DOI: 10.1029/2020JD033811Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.31.04.14  CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF OPP‐1825858 CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF AGS‐1802248Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.Document ID 20170012176 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

Keywords Surface TemperaturArcticcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsProcess drivers, inter-model spread, and a path forward: What do we know about Arctic Amplification?Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the Arctic resulting from enhanced surface warming in the Arctic relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called Arctic Amplification. While surface-based amplification of Arctic warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to Arctic Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in Arctic Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving Arctic Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected Arctic climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the Arctic lapse rate feedback.Document ID 20205010055 Document Type Presentation Authors Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.Document ID 20210011823 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Eric Stofferahn (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Joshua B Fisher (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Daniel J Hayes (University of Maine Orono, Maine, United States) Christopher R Schwalm (Woods Hole Research Center Falmouth, Massachusetts, United States) Deborah N Huntzinger (Northern Arizona University Flagstaff, Arizona, United States)Et alDate Acquired March 23, 2021 Publication Date May 1, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Environmental Research Letters Volume: 14 Issue: 5 DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/ab10faSubject CategoryEarth Resources And Remote SensingFunding Number(s) WBS: 304029.01.20.04.01.02 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC19M0113 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NM0018D0004P00002 CONTRACT_GRANT: GBMF5439 CONTRACT_GRANT: DOE-ERKP818Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.Document ID 20190001702 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Ivy Tan (University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, Maryland, United States) Trude Storelvmo (University of Oslo Oslo, Oslo, Norway)Date Acquired March 20, 2019 Publication Date February 25, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 46 Issue: 5 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081871Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN66580Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NNX15AT34A CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF-1352417Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.Document ID 20140017663 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014Authors Jiao, C.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the Arctic Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of Arctic Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.Document ID 20140006607 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011GL050052Authors Farrell, Sinead Louise (Maryland Univ.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.Document ID 20160000353 Document Type Presentation Authors Orbe, Clara (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Newman, Paul A.

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of Arctic stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the Arctic using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the Arctic between 1995 and 2015.Document ID 20205004491 Document Type Presentation Authors U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.Document ID 20220009666 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2021GL097373&file=2021GL097373-sup-0001-Supporting+Information+SI-S01.pdfAuthors Ivy Tran (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Donifan Barahona (Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland, United States) Quentin Coopman (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada)Date Acquired June 22, 2022 Publication Date January 31, 2022 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 49 Issue: 4 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: 10.1029/2021GL097373Subject CategoryGeophysicsFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.04.03.28 CONTRACT_GRANT: NASA  80NSSC18K1599Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

CARVE bridges critical gaps in our knowledge and understanding of Arctic ecosystems, linkages between the Arctic hydrologic and terrestrial carbon cycles, and the feedbacks from fires and thawing permafrost. CARVE's objectives are to: (1) Directly test hypotheses attributing the mobilization of vulnerable Arctic carbon reservoirs to climate warming; (2) Deliver the first direct measurements and detailed maps of CO2 and CH4 sources on regional scales in the Alaskan Arctic; and (3) Demonstrate new remote sensing and modeling capabilities to quantify feedbacks between carbon fluxes and carbon cycle-climate processes in the Arctic (Figure 1).

Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\n\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.Document ID 20160003310 Document Type Presentation Authors Zamora, Lauren  (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Kahn, R.

In the Arctic, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in Arctic research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the Arctic. Recent trends in Arctic surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and Arctic glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the Arctic Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent Arctic change and provide a context for future scenarios. We further quantify uncertainties in key reanalyses variables and approaches for addressing these issues.Document ID 20190031804 Document Type Poster Authors Andrews, Lauren C.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.Document ID 20140008934 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011JC007257Authors Johnson, Mark (Alaska Univ.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.Document ID 20230001741 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors I.V.

Technical Review External Peer Committee KeywordsWildfireArcticRussiaClimate changeAdaptationSystematic reviewcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsReviews and syntheses: Arctic fire regimes and emissions in the 21st centuryIn recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.Document ID 20210021735 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplementAuthors Jessica L.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.Document ID 20190027361 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Camilla Weum Stjern (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Marianne Tronstad Lund (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Bjorn Hallvard Samset (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Gunnar Myhre (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Piers M Forster  (University of Leeds Leeds, United Kingdom)Et alDate Acquired July 17, 2019 Publication Date June 10, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 124 Issue: 13 ISSN: 2169-897X URL: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029726?af=R DOI: doi:10.1029/2018JD029726Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN69756Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/N006038/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 229771 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC nn2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K500872/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15K12190 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15H01728 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC ns2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 207711/E10 CONTRACT_GRANT: UK BEIZ/DMOHCCP GA01101 CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K007483/1Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.Document ID 20170011215 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.Document ID 20205007200 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-9yp5-6p27Authors Cheng Zheng (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Yutian Wu (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Mingfang Ting (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Clara Orbe (Goddard Institute for Space Studies New York, New York, United States) Xinyue Wang (National Center for Atmospheric Research Boulder, Colorado, United States)Et alDate Acquired September 3, 2020 Publication Date February 1, 2021 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 126 Issue: 4 ISSN: 2169-897X DOI: 10.1029/2020JD033811Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.31.04.14  CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF OPP‐1825858 CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF AGS‐1802248Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.Document ID 20170012176 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

Keywords Surface TemperaturArcticcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsProcess drivers, inter-model spread, and a path forward: What do we know about Arctic Amplification?Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the Arctic resulting from enhanced surface warming in the Arctic relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called Arctic Amplification. While surface-based amplification of Arctic warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to Arctic Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in Arctic Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving Arctic Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected Arctic climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the Arctic lapse rate feedback.Document ID 20205010055 Document Type Presentation Authors Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.Document ID 20210011823 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Eric Stofferahn (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Joshua B Fisher (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Daniel J Hayes (University of Maine Orono, Maine, United States) Christopher R Schwalm (Woods Hole Research Center Falmouth, Massachusetts, United States) Deborah N Huntzinger (Northern Arizona University Flagstaff, Arizona, United States)Et alDate Acquired March 23, 2021 Publication Date May 1, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Environmental Research Letters Volume: 14 Issue: 5 DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/ab10faSubject CategoryEarth Resources And Remote SensingFunding Number(s) WBS: 304029.01.20.04.01.02 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC19M0113 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NM0018D0004P00002 CONTRACT_GRANT: GBMF5439 CONTRACT_GRANT: DOE-ERKP818Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.Document ID 20190001702 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Ivy Tan (University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, Maryland, United States) Trude Storelvmo (University of Oslo Oslo, Oslo, Norway)Date Acquired March 20, 2019 Publication Date February 25, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 46 Issue: 5 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081871Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN66580Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NNX15AT34A CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF-1352417Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.Document ID 20140017663 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014Authors Jiao, C.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the Arctic Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of Arctic Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.Document ID 20140006607 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011GL050052Authors Farrell, Sinead Louise (Maryland Univ.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.Document ID 20160000353 Document Type Presentation Authors Orbe, Clara (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Newman, Paul A.

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of Arctic stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the Arctic using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the Arctic between 1995 and 2015.Document ID 20205004491 Document Type Presentation Authors U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.Document ID 20220009666 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2021GL097373&file=2021GL097373-sup-0001-Supporting+Information+SI-S01.pdfAuthors Ivy Tran (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Donifan Barahona (Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland, United States) Quentin Coopman (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada)Date Acquired June 22, 2022 Publication Date January 31, 2022 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 49 Issue: 4 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: 10.1029/2021GL097373Subject CategoryGeophysicsFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.04.03.28 CONTRACT_GRANT: NASA  80NSSC18K1599Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\n\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.Document ID 20160003310 Document Type Presentation Authors Zamora, Lauren  (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Kahn, R.

In the Arctic, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in Arctic research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the Arctic. Recent trends in Arctic surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and Arctic glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the Arctic Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent Arctic change and provide a context for future scenarios. We further quantify uncertainties in key reanalyses variables and approaches for addressing these issues.Document ID 20190031804 Document Type Poster Authors Andrews, Lauren C.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.Document ID 20140008934 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011JC007257Authors Johnson, Mark (Alaska Univ.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.Document ID 20230001741 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors I.V.

Technical Review External Peer Committee KeywordsWildfireArcticRussiaClimate changeAdaptationSystematic reviewcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsReviews and syntheses: Arctic fire regimes and emissions in the 21st centuryIn recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.Document ID 20210021735 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplementAuthors Jessica L.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.Document ID 20190027361 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Camilla Weum Stjern (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Marianne Tronstad Lund (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Bjorn Hallvard Samset (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Gunnar Myhre (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Piers M Forster  (University of Leeds Leeds, United Kingdom)Et alDate Acquired July 17, 2019 Publication Date June 10, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 124 Issue: 13 ISSN: 2169-897X URL: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029726?af=R DOI: doi:10.1029/2018JD029726Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN69756Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/N006038/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 229771 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC nn2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K500872/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15K12190 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15H01728 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC ns2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 207711/E10 CONTRACT_GRANT: UK BEIZ/DMOHCCP GA01101 CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K007483/1Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.Document ID 20170011215 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.Document ID 20205007200 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-9yp5-6p27Authors Cheng Zheng (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Yutian Wu (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Mingfang Ting (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Clara Orbe (Goddard Institute for Space Studies New York, New York, United States) Xinyue Wang (National Center for Atmospheric Research Boulder, Colorado, United States)Et alDate Acquired September 3, 2020 Publication Date February 1, 2021 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 126 Issue: 4 ISSN: 2169-897X DOI: 10.1029/2020JD033811Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.31.04.14  CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF OPP‐1825858 CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF AGS‐1802248Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.Document ID 20170012176 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

Keywords Surface TemperaturArcticcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsProcess drivers, inter-model spread, and a path forward: What do we know about Arctic Amplification?Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the Arctic resulting from enhanced surface warming in the Arctic relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called Arctic Amplification. While surface-based amplification of Arctic warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to Arctic Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in Arctic Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving Arctic Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected Arctic climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the Arctic lapse rate feedback.Document ID 20205010055 Document Type Presentation Authors Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.Document ID 20210011823 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Eric Stofferahn (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Joshua B Fisher (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Daniel J Hayes (University of Maine Orono, Maine, United States) Christopher R Schwalm (Woods Hole Research Center Falmouth, Massachusetts, United States) Deborah N Huntzinger (Northern Arizona University Flagstaff, Arizona, United States)Et alDate Acquired March 23, 2021 Publication Date May 1, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Environmental Research Letters Volume: 14 Issue: 5 DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/ab10faSubject CategoryEarth Resources And Remote SensingFunding Number(s) WBS: 304029.01.20.04.01.02 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC19M0113 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NM0018D0004P00002 CONTRACT_GRANT: GBMF5439 CONTRACT_GRANT: DOE-ERKP818Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.Document ID 20190001702 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Ivy Tan (University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, Maryland, United States) Trude Storelvmo (University of Oslo Oslo, Oslo, Norway)Date Acquired March 20, 2019 Publication Date February 25, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 46 Issue: 5 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081871Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN66580Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NNX15AT34A CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF-1352417Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.Document ID 20140017663 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014Authors Jiao, C.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the Arctic Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of Arctic Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.Document ID 20140006607 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011GL050052Authors Farrell, Sinead Louise (Maryland Univ.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.Document ID 20160000353 Document Type Presentation Authors Orbe, Clara (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Newman, Paul A.

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of Arctic stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the Arctic using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the Arctic between 1995 and 2015.Document ID 20205004491 Document Type Presentation Authors U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.Document ID 20220009666 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2021GL097373&file=2021GL097373-sup-0001-Supporting+Information+SI-S01.pdfAuthors Ivy Tran (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Donifan Barahona (Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland, United States) Quentin Coopman (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada)Date Acquired June 22, 2022 Publication Date January 31, 2022 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 49 Issue: 4 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: 10.1029/2021GL097373Subject CategoryGeophysicsFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.04.03.28 CONTRACT_GRANT: NASA  80NSSC18K1599Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

CARVE bridges critical gaps in our knowledge and understanding of Arctic ecosystems, linkages between the Arctic hydrologic and terrestrial carbon cycles, and the feedbacks from fires and thawing permafrost. CARVE's objectives are to: (1) Directly test hypotheses attributing the mobilization of vulnerable Arctic carbon reservoirs to climate warming; (2) Deliver the first direct measurements and detailed maps of CO2 and CH4 sources on regional scales in the Alaskan Arctic; and (3) Demonstrate new remote sensing and modeling capabilities to quantify feedbacks between carbon fluxes and carbon cycle-climate processes in the Arctic (Figure 1).

Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\n\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.Document ID 20160003310 Document Type Presentation Authors Zamora, Lauren  (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Kahn, R.

In the Arctic, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in Arctic research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the Arctic. Recent trends in Arctic surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and Arctic glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the Arctic Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent Arctic change and provide a context for future scenarios. We further quantify uncertainties in key reanalyses variables and approaches for addressing these issues.Document ID 20190031804 Document Type Poster Authors Andrews, Lauren C.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.Document ID 20230001741 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors I.V.

Technical Review External Peer Committee KeywordsWildfireArcticRussiaClimate changeAdaptationSystematic reviewcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsReviews and syntheses: Arctic fire regimes and emissions in the 21st centuryIn recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.Document ID 20210021735 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplementAuthors Jessica L.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.Document ID 20190027361 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Camilla Weum Stjern (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Marianne Tronstad Lund (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Bjorn Hallvard Samset (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Gunnar Myhre (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Piers M Forster  (University of Leeds Leeds, United Kingdom)Et alDate Acquired July 17, 2019 Publication Date June 10, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 124 Issue: 13 ISSN: 2169-897X URL: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029726?af=R DOI: doi:10.1029/2018JD029726Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN69756Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/N006038/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 229771 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC nn2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K500872/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15K12190 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15H01728 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC ns2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 207711/E10 CONTRACT_GRANT: UK BEIZ/DMOHCCP GA01101 CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K007483/1Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.Document ID 20170011215 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.Document ID 20205007200 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-9yp5-6p27Authors Cheng Zheng (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Yutian Wu (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Mingfang Ting (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Clara Orbe (Goddard Institute for Space Studies New York, New York, United States) Xinyue Wang (National Center for Atmospheric Research Boulder, Colorado, United States)Et alDate Acquired September 3, 2020 Publication Date February 1, 2021 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 126 Issue: 4 ISSN: 2169-897X DOI: 10.1029/2020JD033811Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.31.04.14  CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF OPP‐1825858 CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF AGS‐1802248Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.Document ID 20170012176 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

Keywords Surface TemperaturArcticcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsProcess drivers, inter-model spread, and a path forward: What do we know about Arctic Amplification?Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the Arctic resulting from enhanced surface warming in the Arctic relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called Arctic Amplification. While surface-based amplification of Arctic warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to Arctic Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in Arctic Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving Arctic Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected Arctic climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the Arctic lapse rate feedback.Document ID 20205010055 Document Type Presentation Authors Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.Document ID 20210011823 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Eric Stofferahn (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Joshua B Fisher (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Daniel J Hayes (University of Maine Orono, Maine, United States) Christopher R Schwalm (Woods Hole Research Center Falmouth, Massachusetts, United States) Deborah N Huntzinger (Northern Arizona University Flagstaff, Arizona, United States)Et alDate Acquired March 23, 2021 Publication Date May 1, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Environmental Research Letters Volume: 14 Issue: 5 DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/ab10faSubject CategoryEarth Resources And Remote SensingFunding Number(s) WBS: 304029.01.20.04.01.02 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC19M0113 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NM0018D0004P00002 CONTRACT_GRANT: GBMF5439 CONTRACT_GRANT: DOE-ERKP818Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.Document ID 20190001702 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Ivy Tan (University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, Maryland, United States) Trude Storelvmo (University of Oslo Oslo, Oslo, Norway)Date Acquired March 20, 2019 Publication Date February 25, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 46 Issue: 5 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081871Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN66580Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NNX15AT34A CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF-1352417Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.Document ID 20140017663 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014Authors Jiao, C.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the Arctic Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of Arctic Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.Document ID 20140006607 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011GL050052Authors Farrell, Sinead Louise (Maryland Univ.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.Document ID 20160000353 Document Type Presentation Authors Orbe, Clara (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Newman, Paul A.

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of Arctic stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the Arctic using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the Arctic between 1995 and 2015.Document ID 20205004491 Document Type Presentation Authors U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.Document ID 20220009666 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2021GL097373&file=2021GL097373-sup-0001-Supporting+Information+SI-S01.pdfAuthors Ivy Tran (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Donifan Barahona (Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland, United States) Quentin Coopman (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada)Date Acquired June 22, 2022 Publication Date January 31, 2022 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 49 Issue: 4 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: 10.1029/2021GL097373Subject CategoryGeophysicsFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.04.03.28 CONTRACT_GRANT: NASA  80NSSC18K1599Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

CARVE bridges critical gaps in our knowledge and understanding of Arctic ecosystems, linkages between the Arctic hydrologic and terrestrial carbon cycles, and the feedbacks from fires and thawing permafrost. CARVE's objectives are to: (1) Directly test hypotheses attributing the mobilization of vulnerable Arctic carbon reservoirs to climate warming; (2) Deliver the first direct measurements and detailed maps of CO2 and CH4 sources on regional scales in the Alaskan Arctic; and (3) Demonstrate new remote sensing and modeling capabilities to quantify feedbacks between carbon fluxes and carbon cycle-climate processes in the Arctic (Figure 1).

Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\n\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.Document ID 20160003310 Document Type Presentation Authors Zamora, Lauren  (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Kahn, R.

gridded, retrospective depictions of the physical earth system, which are produced through the correction of a short-term forecast to available observations. In the Arctic, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in Arctic research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the Arctic. Recent trends in Arctic surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and Arctic glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the Arctic Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent Arctic change and provide a context for future scenarios. We further quantify uncertainties in key reanalyses variables and approaches for addressing these issues.Document ID 20190031804 Document Type Poster Authors Andrews, Lauren C.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.Document ID 20140008934 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011JC007257Authors Johnson, Mark (Alaska Univ.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.Document ID 20230001741 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors I.V.

Technical Review External Peer Committee KeywordsWildfireArcticRussiaClimate changeAdaptationSystematic reviewcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsReviews and syntheses: Arctic fire regimes and emissions in the 21st centuryIn recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.Document ID 20210021735 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplementAuthors Jessica L.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.Document ID 20190027361 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Camilla Weum Stjern (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Marianne Tronstad Lund (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Bjorn Hallvard Samset (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Gunnar Myhre (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Piers M Forster  (University of Leeds Leeds, United Kingdom)Et alDate Acquired July 17, 2019 Publication Date June 10, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 124 Issue: 13 ISSN: 2169-897X URL: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029726?af=R DOI: doi:10.1029/2018JD029726Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN69756Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/N006038/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 229771 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC nn2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K500872/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15K12190 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15H01728 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC ns2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 207711/E10 CONTRACT_GRANT: UK BEIZ/DMOHCCP GA01101 CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K007483/1Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.Document ID 20170011215 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.Document ID 20205007200 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-9yp5-6p27Authors Cheng Zheng (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Yutian Wu (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Mingfang Ting (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Clara Orbe (Goddard Institute for Space Studies New York, New York, United States) Xinyue Wang (National Center for Atmospheric Research Boulder, Colorado, United States)Et alDate Acquired September 3, 2020 Publication Date February 1, 2021 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 126 Issue: 4 ISSN: 2169-897X DOI: 10.1029/2020JD033811Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.31.04.14  CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF OPP‐1825858 CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF AGS‐1802248Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.Document ID 20170012176 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

Keywords Surface TemperaturArcticcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsProcess drivers, inter-model spread, and a path forward: What do we know about Arctic Amplification?Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the Arctic resulting from enhanced surface warming in the Arctic relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called Arctic Amplification. While surface-based amplification of Arctic warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to Arctic Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in Arctic Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving Arctic Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected Arctic climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the Arctic lapse rate feedback.Document ID 20205010055 Document Type Presentation Authors Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.Document ID 20210011823 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Eric Stofferahn (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Joshua B Fisher (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Daniel J Hayes (University of Maine Orono, Maine, United States) Christopher R Schwalm (Woods Hole Research Center Falmouth, Massachusetts, United States) Deborah N Huntzinger (Northern Arizona University Flagstaff, Arizona, United States)Et alDate Acquired March 23, 2021 Publication Date May 1, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Environmental Research Letters Volume: 14 Issue: 5 DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/ab10faSubject CategoryEarth Resources And Remote SensingFunding Number(s) WBS: 304029.01.20.04.01.02 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC19M0113 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NM0018D0004P00002 CONTRACT_GRANT: GBMF5439 CONTRACT_GRANT: DOE-ERKP818Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.Document ID 20190001702 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Ivy Tan (University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, Maryland, United States) Trude Storelvmo (University of Oslo Oslo, Oslo, Norway)Date Acquired March 20, 2019 Publication Date February 25, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 46 Issue: 5 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081871Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN66580Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NNX15AT34A CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF-1352417Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.Document ID 20140017663 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014Authors Jiao, C.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the Arctic Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of Arctic Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.Document ID 20140006607 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011GL050052Authors Farrell, Sinead Louise (Maryland Univ.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.Document ID 20160000353 Document Type Presentation Authors Orbe, Clara (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Newman, Paul A.

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of Arctic stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the Arctic using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the Arctic between 1995 and 2015.Document ID 20205004491 Document Type Presentation Authors U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.Document ID 20220009666 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2021GL097373&file=2021GL097373-sup-0001-Supporting+Information+SI-S01.pdfAuthors Ivy Tran (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Donifan Barahona (Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland, United States) Quentin Coopman (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada)Date Acquired June 22, 2022 Publication Date January 31, 2022 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 49 Issue: 4 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: 10.1029/2021GL097373Subject CategoryGeophysicsFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.04.03.28 CONTRACT_GRANT: NASA  80NSSC18K1599Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

KeywordsARCTICANTARCTICAGEOMAGNETIC PULSATIONDocument InquiryDetailsEvaluation of Arctic Warming in Mid-Pliocene Climate SimulationsPalaeoclimate simulations improve our understanding of the climate, inform us about the performance of climate models in a different climate scenario, and help to identify robust features of the climate system. Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\n\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.Document ID 20160003310 Document Type Presentation Authors Zamora, Lauren  (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Kahn, R.

In the Arctic, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in Arctic research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the Arctic. Recent trends in Arctic surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and Arctic glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the Arctic Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent Arctic change and provide a context for future scenarios. We further quantify uncertainties in key reanalyses variables and approaches for addressing these issues.Document ID 20190031804 Document Type Poster Authors Andrews, Lauren C.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.Document ID 20140008934 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011JC007257Authors Johnson, Mark (Alaska Univ.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.Document ID 20230001741 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors I.V.

Technical Review External Peer Committee KeywordsWildfireArcticRussiaClimate changeAdaptationSystematic reviewcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsReviews and syntheses: Arctic fire regimes and emissions in the 21st centuryIn recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.Document ID 20210021735 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplementAuthors Jessica L.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.Document ID 20190027361 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Camilla Weum Stjern (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Marianne Tronstad Lund (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Bjorn Hallvard Samset (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Gunnar Myhre (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Piers M Forster  (University of Leeds Leeds, United Kingdom)Et alDate Acquired July 17, 2019 Publication Date June 10, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 124 Issue: 13 ISSN: 2169-897X URL: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029726?af=R DOI: doi:10.1029/2018JD029726Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN69756Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/N006038/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 229771 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC nn2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K500872/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15K12190 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15H01728 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC ns2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 207711/E10 CONTRACT_GRANT: UK BEIZ/DMOHCCP GA01101 CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K007483/1Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.Document ID 20170011215 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.Document ID 20205007200 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-9yp5-6p27Authors Cheng Zheng (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Yutian Wu (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Mingfang Ting (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Clara Orbe (Goddard Institute for Space Studies New York, New York, United States) Xinyue Wang (National Center for Atmospheric Research Boulder, Colorado, United States)Et alDate Acquired September 3, 2020 Publication Date February 1, 2021 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 126 Issue: 4 ISSN: 2169-897X DOI: 10.1029/2020JD033811Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.31.04.14  CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF OPP‐1825858 CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF AGS‐1802248Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.Document ID 20170012176 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

Keywords Surface TemperaturArcticcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsProcess drivers, inter-model spread, and a path forward: What do we know about Arctic Amplification?Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the Arctic resulting from enhanced surface warming in the Arctic relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called Arctic Amplification. While surface-based amplification of Arctic warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to Arctic Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in Arctic Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving Arctic Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected Arctic climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the Arctic lapse rate feedback.Document ID 20205010055 Document Type Presentation Authors Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.Document ID 20210011823 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Eric Stofferahn (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Joshua B Fisher (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Daniel J Hayes (University of Maine Orono, Maine, United States) Christopher R Schwalm (Woods Hole Research Center Falmouth, Massachusetts, United States) Deborah N Huntzinger (Northern Arizona University Flagstaff, Arizona, United States)Et alDate Acquired March 23, 2021 Publication Date May 1, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Environmental Research Letters Volume: 14 Issue: 5 DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/ab10faSubject CategoryEarth Resources And Remote SensingFunding Number(s) WBS: 304029.01.20.04.01.02 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC19M0113 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NM0018D0004P00002 CONTRACT_GRANT: GBMF5439 CONTRACT_GRANT: DOE-ERKP818Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.Document ID 20190001702 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Ivy Tan (University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, Maryland, United States) Trude Storelvmo (University of Oslo Oslo, Oslo, Norway)Date Acquired March 20, 2019 Publication Date February 25, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 46 Issue: 5 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081871Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN66580Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NNX15AT34A CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF-1352417Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.Document ID 20140017663 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014Authors Jiao, C.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the Arctic Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of Arctic Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.Document ID 20140006607 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011GL050052Authors Farrell, Sinead Louise (Maryland Univ.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.Document ID 20160000353 Document Type Presentation Authors Orbe, Clara (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Newman, Paul A.

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of Arctic stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the Arctic using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the Arctic between 1995 and 2015.Document ID 20205004491 Document Type Presentation Authors U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.Document ID 20220009666 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2021GL097373&file=2021GL097373-sup-0001-Supporting+Information+SI-S01.pdfAuthors Ivy Tran (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Donifan Barahona (Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland, United States) Quentin Coopman (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada)Date Acquired June 22, 2022 Publication Date January 31, 2022 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 49 Issue: 4 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: 10.1029/2021GL097373Subject CategoryGeophysicsFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.04.03.28 CONTRACT_GRANT: NASA  80NSSC18K1599Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

CARVE bridges critical gaps in our knowledge and understanding of Arctic ecosystems, linkages between the Arctic hydrologic and terrestrial carbon cycles, and the feedbacks from fires and thawing permafrost. CARVE's objectives are to: (1) Directly test hypotheses attributing the mobilization of vulnerable Arctic carbon reservoirs to climate warming; (2) Deliver the first direct measurements and detailed maps of CO2 and CH4 sources on regional scales in the Alaskan Arctic; and (3) Demonstrate new remote sensing and modeling capabilities to quantify feedbacks between carbon fluxes and carbon cycle-climate processes in the Arctic (Figure 1).

Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\n\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.Document ID 20160003310 Document Type Presentation Authors Zamora, Lauren  (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Kahn, R.

In the Arctic, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in Arctic research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the Arctic. Recent trends in Arctic surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and Arctic glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the Arctic Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent Arctic change and provide a context for future scenarios. We further quantify uncertainties in key reanalyses variables and approaches for addressing these issues.Document ID 20190031804 Document Type Poster Authors Andrews, Lauren C.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.Document ID 20140008934 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011JC007257Authors Johnson, Mark (Alaska Univ.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.Document ID 20230001741 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors I.V.

Technical Review External Peer Committee KeywordsWildfireArcticRussiaClimate changeAdaptationSystematic reviewcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsReviews and syntheses: Arctic fire regimes and emissions in the 21st centuryIn recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.Document ID 20210021735 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplementAuthors Jessica L.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.Document ID 20190027361 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Camilla Weum Stjern (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Marianne Tronstad Lund (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Bjorn Hallvard Samset (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Gunnar Myhre (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Piers M Forster  (University of Leeds Leeds, United Kingdom)Et alDate Acquired July 17, 2019 Publication Date June 10, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 124 Issue: 13 ISSN: 2169-897X URL: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029726?af=R DOI: doi:10.1029/2018JD029726Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN69756Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/N006038/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 229771 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC nn2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K500872/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15K12190 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15H01728 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC ns2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 207711/E10 CONTRACT_GRANT: UK BEIZ/DMOHCCP GA01101 CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K007483/1Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.Document ID 20170011215 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.Document ID 20205007200 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-9yp5-6p27Authors Cheng Zheng (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Yutian Wu (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Mingfang Ting (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Clara Orbe (Goddard Institute for Space Studies New York, New York, United States) Xinyue Wang (National Center for Atmospheric Research Boulder, Colorado, United States)Et alDate Acquired September 3, 2020 Publication Date February 1, 2021 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 126 Issue: 4 ISSN: 2169-897X DOI: 10.1029/2020JD033811Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.31.04.14  CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF OPP‐1825858 CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF AGS‐1802248Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.Document ID 20170012176 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

Keywords Surface TemperaturArcticcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsProcess drivers, inter-model spread, and a path forward: What do we know about Arctic Amplification?Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the Arctic resulting from enhanced surface warming in the Arctic relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called Arctic Amplification. While surface-based amplification of Arctic warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to Arctic Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in Arctic Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving Arctic Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected Arctic climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the Arctic lapse rate feedback.Document ID 20205010055 Document Type Presentation Authors Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.Document ID 20210011823 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Eric Stofferahn (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Joshua B Fisher (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Daniel J Hayes (University of Maine Orono, Maine, United States) Christopher R Schwalm (Woods Hole Research Center Falmouth, Massachusetts, United States) Deborah N Huntzinger (Northern Arizona University Flagstaff, Arizona, United States)Et alDate Acquired March 23, 2021 Publication Date May 1, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Environmental Research Letters Volume: 14 Issue: 5 DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/ab10faSubject CategoryEarth Resources And Remote SensingFunding Number(s) WBS: 304029.01.20.04.01.02 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC19M0113 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NM0018D0004P00002 CONTRACT_GRANT: GBMF5439 CONTRACT_GRANT: DOE-ERKP818Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.Document ID 20190001702 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Ivy Tan (University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, Maryland, United States) Trude Storelvmo (University of Oslo Oslo, Oslo, Norway)Date Acquired March 20, 2019 Publication Date February 25, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 46 Issue: 5 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081871Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN66580Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NNX15AT34A CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF-1352417Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.Document ID 20140017663 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014Authors Jiao, C.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the Arctic Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of Arctic Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.Document ID 20140006607 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011GL050052Authors Farrell, Sinead Louise (Maryland Univ.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.Document ID 20160000353 Document Type Presentation Authors Orbe, Clara (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Newman, Paul A.

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of Arctic stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the Arctic using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the Arctic between 1995 and 2015.Document ID 20205004491 Document Type Presentation Authors U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.Document ID 20220009666 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2021GL097373&file=2021GL097373-sup-0001-Supporting+Information+SI-S01.pdfAuthors Ivy Tran (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Donifan Barahona (Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland, United States) Quentin Coopman (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada)Date Acquired June 22, 2022 Publication Date January 31, 2022 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 49 Issue: 4 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: 10.1029/2021GL097373Subject CategoryGeophysicsFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.04.03.28 CONTRACT_GRANT: NASA  80NSSC18K1599Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

CARVE bridges critical gaps in our knowledge and understanding of Arctic ecosystems, linkages between the Arctic hydrologic and terrestrial carbon cycles, and the feedbacks from fires and thawing permafrost. CARVE's objectives are to: (1) Directly test hypotheses attributing the mobilization of vulnerable Arctic carbon reservoirs to climate warming; (2) Deliver the first direct measurements and detailed maps of CO2 and CH4 sources on regional scales in the Alaskan Arctic; and (3) Demonstrate new remote sensing and modeling capabilities to quantify feedbacks between carbon fluxes and carbon cycle-climate processes in the Arctic (Figure 1).

Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\n\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.Document ID 20160003310 Document Type Presentation Authors Zamora, Lauren  (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Kahn, R.

In the Arctic, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in Arctic research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the Arctic. Recent trends in Arctic surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and Arctic glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the Arctic Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent Arctic change and provide a context for future scenarios. We further quantify uncertainties in key reanalyses variables and approaches for addressing these issues.Document ID 20190031804 Document Type Poster Authors Andrews, Lauren C.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.Document ID 20140008934 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011JC007257Authors Johnson, Mark (Alaska Univ.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.Document ID 20230001741 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors I.V.

Technical Review External Peer Committee KeywordsWildfireArcticRussiaClimate changeAdaptationSystematic reviewcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsReviews and syntheses: Arctic fire regimes and emissions in the 21st centuryIn recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.Document ID 20210021735 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplementAuthors Jessica L.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.Document ID 20190027361 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Camilla Weum Stjern (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Marianne Tronstad Lund (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Bjorn Hallvard Samset (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Gunnar Myhre (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Piers M Forster  (University of Leeds Leeds, United Kingdom)Et alDate Acquired July 17, 2019 Publication Date June 10, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 124 Issue: 13 ISSN: 2169-897X URL: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029726?af=R DOI: doi:10.1029/2018JD029726Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN69756Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/N006038/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 229771 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC nn2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K500872/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15K12190 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15H01728 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC ns2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 207711/E10 CONTRACT_GRANT: UK BEIZ/DMOHCCP GA01101 CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K007483/1Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.Document ID 20170011215 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.Document ID 20205007200 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-9yp5-6p27Authors Cheng Zheng (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Yutian Wu (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Mingfang Ting (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Clara Orbe (Goddard Institute for Space Studies New York, New York, United States) Xinyue Wang (National Center for Atmospheric Research Boulder, Colorado, United States)Et alDate Acquired September 3, 2020 Publication Date February 1, 2021 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 126 Issue: 4 ISSN: 2169-897X DOI: 10.1029/2020JD033811Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.31.04.14  CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF OPP‐1825858 CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF AGS‐1802248Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.Document ID 20170012176 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

Keywords Surface TemperaturArcticcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsProcess drivers, inter-model spread, and a path forward: What do we know about Arctic Amplification?Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the Arctic resulting from enhanced surface warming in the Arctic relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called Arctic Amplification. While surface-based amplification of Arctic warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to Arctic Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in Arctic Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving Arctic Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected Arctic climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the Arctic lapse rate feedback.Document ID 20205010055 Document Type Presentation Authors Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.Document ID 20210011823 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Eric Stofferahn (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Joshua B Fisher (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Daniel J Hayes (University of Maine Orono, Maine, United States) Christopher R Schwalm (Woods Hole Research Center Falmouth, Massachusetts, United States) Deborah N Huntzinger (Northern Arizona University Flagstaff, Arizona, United States)Et alDate Acquired March 23, 2021 Publication Date May 1, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Environmental Research Letters Volume: 14 Issue: 5 DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/ab10faSubject CategoryEarth Resources And Remote SensingFunding Number(s) WBS: 304029.01.20.04.01.02 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC19M0113 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NM0018D0004P00002 CONTRACT_GRANT: GBMF5439 CONTRACT_GRANT: DOE-ERKP818Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.Document ID 20190001702 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Ivy Tan (University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, Maryland, United States) Trude Storelvmo (University of Oslo Oslo, Oslo, Norway)Date Acquired March 20, 2019 Publication Date February 25, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 46 Issue: 5 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081871Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN66580Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NNX15AT34A CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF-1352417Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.Document ID 20140017663 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014Authors Jiao, C.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the Arctic Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of Arctic Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.Document ID 20140006607 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011GL050052Authors Farrell, Sinead Louise (Maryland Univ.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.Document ID 20160000353 Document Type Presentation Authors Orbe, Clara (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Newman, Paul A.

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of Arctic stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the Arctic using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the Arctic between 1995 and 2015.Document ID 20205004491 Document Type Presentation Authors U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.Document ID 20220009666 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2021GL097373&file=2021GL097373-sup-0001-Supporting+Information+SI-S01.pdfAuthors Ivy Tran (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Donifan Barahona (Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland, United States) Quentin Coopman (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada)Date Acquired June 22, 2022 Publication Date January 31, 2022 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 49 Issue: 4 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: 10.1029/2021GL097373Subject CategoryGeophysicsFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.04.03.28 CONTRACT_GRANT: NASA  80NSSC18K1599Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

CARVE bridges critical gaps in our knowledge and understanding of Arctic ecosystems, linkages between the Arctic hydrologic and terrestrial carbon cycles, and the feedbacks from fires and thawing permafrost. CARVE's objectives are to: (1) Directly test hypotheses attributing the mobilization of vulnerable Arctic carbon reservoirs to climate warming; (2) Deliver the first direct measurements and detailed maps of CO2 and CH4 sources on regional scales in the Alaskan Arctic; and (3) Demonstrate new remote sensing and modeling capabilities to quantify feedbacks between carbon fluxes and carbon cycle-climate processes in the Arctic (Figure 1). We describe the investigation design and results from 2011 test flights in Alaska.Document ID 20150008711 Document Type Conference Paper External Source(s)hdl:2014/44930Authors Miller, Charles E.

Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\n\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.Document ID 20160003310 Document Type Presentation Authors Zamora, Lauren  (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Kahn, R.

In the Arctic, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in Arctic research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the Arctic. Recent trends in Arctic surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and Arctic glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the Arctic Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent Arctic change and provide a context for future scenarios. We further quantify uncertainties in key reanalyses variables and approaches for addressing these issues.Document ID 20190031804 Document Type Poster Authors Andrews, Lauren C.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.Document ID 20140008934 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011JC007257Authors Johnson, Mark (Alaska Univ.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.Document ID 20230001741 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors I.V.

Technical Review External Peer Committee KeywordsWildfireArcticRussiaClimate changeAdaptationSystematic reviewcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsReviews and syntheses: Arctic fire regimes and emissions in the 21st centuryIn recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.Document ID 20210021735 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplementAuthors Jessica L.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.Document ID 20190027361 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Camilla Weum Stjern (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Marianne Tronstad Lund (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Bjorn Hallvard Samset (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Gunnar Myhre (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Piers M Forster  (University of Leeds Leeds, United Kingdom)Et alDate Acquired July 17, 2019 Publication Date June 10, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 124 Issue: 13 ISSN: 2169-897X URL: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029726?af=R DOI: doi:10.1029/2018JD029726Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN69756Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/N006038/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 229771 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC nn2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K500872/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15K12190 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15H01728 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC ns2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 207711/E10 CONTRACT_GRANT: UK BEIZ/DMOHCCP GA01101 CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K007483/1Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.Document ID 20170011215 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.Document ID 20205007200 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-9yp5-6p27Authors Cheng Zheng (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Yutian Wu (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Mingfang Ting (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Clara Orbe (Goddard Institute for Space Studies New York, New York, United States) Xinyue Wang (National Center for Atmospheric Research Boulder, Colorado, United States)Et alDate Acquired September 3, 2020 Publication Date February 1, 2021 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 126 Issue: 4 ISSN: 2169-897X DOI: 10.1029/2020JD033811Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.31.04.14  CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF OPP‐1825858 CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF AGS‐1802248Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.Document ID 20170012176 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

Keywords Surface TemperaturArcticcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsProcess drivers, inter-model spread, and a path forward: What do we know about Arctic Amplification?Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the Arctic resulting from enhanced surface warming in the Arctic relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called Arctic Amplification. While surface-based amplification of Arctic warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to Arctic Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in Arctic Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving Arctic Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected Arctic climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the Arctic lapse rate feedback.Document ID 20205010055 Document Type Presentation Authors Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.Document ID 20210011823 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Eric Stofferahn (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Joshua B Fisher (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Daniel J Hayes (University of Maine Orono, Maine, United States) Christopher R Schwalm (Woods Hole Research Center Falmouth, Massachusetts, United States) Deborah N Huntzinger (Northern Arizona University Flagstaff, Arizona, United States)Et alDate Acquired March 23, 2021 Publication Date May 1, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Environmental Research Letters Volume: 14 Issue: 5 DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/ab10faSubject CategoryEarth Resources And Remote SensingFunding Number(s) WBS: 304029.01.20.04.01.02 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC19M0113 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NM0018D0004P00002 CONTRACT_GRANT: GBMF5439 CONTRACT_GRANT: DOE-ERKP818Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.Document ID 20190001702 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Ivy Tan (University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, Maryland, United States) Trude Storelvmo (University of Oslo Oslo, Oslo, Norway)Date Acquired March 20, 2019 Publication Date February 25, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 46 Issue: 5 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081871Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN66580Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NNX15AT34A CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF-1352417Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.Document ID 20140017663 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014Authors Jiao, C.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the Arctic Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of Arctic Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.Document ID 20140006607 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011GL050052Authors Farrell, Sinead Louise (Maryland Univ.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.Document ID 20160000353 Document Type Presentation Authors Orbe, Clara (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Newman, Paul A.

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of Arctic stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the Arctic using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the Arctic between 1995 and 2015.Document ID 20205004491 Document Type Presentation Authors U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.Document ID 20220009666 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2021GL097373&file=2021GL097373-sup-0001-Supporting+Information+SI-S01.pdfAuthors Ivy Tran (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Donifan Barahona (Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland, United States) Quentin Coopman (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada)Date Acquired June 22, 2022 Publication Date January 31, 2022 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 49 Issue: 4 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: 10.1029/2021GL097373Subject CategoryGeophysicsFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.04.03.28 CONTRACT_GRANT: NASA  80NSSC18K1599Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\n\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.Document ID 20160003310 Document Type Presentation Authors Zamora, Lauren  (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Kahn, R.

In the Arctic, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in Arctic research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the Arctic. Recent trends in Arctic surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and Arctic glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the Arctic Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent Arctic change and provide a context for future scenarios. We further quantify uncertainties in key reanalyses variables and approaches for addressing these issues.Document ID 20190031804 Document Type Poster Authors Andrews, Lauren C.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.Document ID 20140008934 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011JC007257Authors Johnson, Mark (Alaska Univ.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.Document ID 20230001741 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors I.V.

Technical Review External Peer Committee KeywordsWildfireArcticRussiaClimate changeAdaptationSystematic reviewcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsReviews and syntheses: Arctic fire regimes and emissions in the 21st centuryIn recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.Document ID 20210021735 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplementAuthors Jessica L.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.Document ID 20190027361 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Camilla Weum Stjern (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Marianne Tronstad Lund (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Bjorn Hallvard Samset (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Gunnar Myhre (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Piers M Forster  (University of Leeds Leeds, United Kingdom)Et alDate Acquired July 17, 2019 Publication Date June 10, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 124 Issue: 13 ISSN: 2169-897X URL: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029726?af=R DOI: doi:10.1029/2018JD029726Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN69756Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/N006038/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 229771 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC nn2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K500872/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15K12190 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15H01728 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC ns2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 207711/E10 CONTRACT_GRANT: UK BEIZ/DMOHCCP GA01101 CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K007483/1Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.Document ID 20170011215 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.Document ID 20205007200 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-9yp5-6p27Authors Cheng Zheng (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Yutian Wu (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Mingfang Ting (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Clara Orbe (Goddard Institute for Space Studies New York, New York, United States) Xinyue Wang (National Center for Atmospheric Research Boulder, Colorado, United States)Et alDate Acquired September 3, 2020 Publication Date February 1, 2021 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 126 Issue: 4 ISSN: 2169-897X DOI: 10.1029/2020JD033811Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.31.04.14  CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF OPP‐1825858 CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF AGS‐1802248Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.Document ID 20170012176 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

Keywords Surface TemperaturArcticcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsProcess drivers, inter-model spread, and a path forward: What do we know about Arctic Amplification?Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the Arctic resulting from enhanced surface warming in the Arctic relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called Arctic Amplification. While surface-based amplification of Arctic warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to Arctic Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in Arctic Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving Arctic Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected Arctic climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the Arctic lapse rate feedback.Document ID 20205010055 Document Type Presentation Authors Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.Document ID 20210011823 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Eric Stofferahn (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Joshua B Fisher (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Daniel J Hayes (University of Maine Orono, Maine, United States) Christopher R Schwalm (Woods Hole Research Center Falmouth, Massachusetts, United States) Deborah N Huntzinger (Northern Arizona University Flagstaff, Arizona, United States)Et alDate Acquired March 23, 2021 Publication Date May 1, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Environmental Research Letters Volume: 14 Issue: 5 DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/ab10faSubject CategoryEarth Resources And Remote SensingFunding Number(s) WBS: 304029.01.20.04.01.02 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC19M0113 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NM0018D0004P00002 CONTRACT_GRANT: GBMF5439 CONTRACT_GRANT: DOE-ERKP818Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.Document ID 20190001702 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Ivy Tan (University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, Maryland, United States) Trude Storelvmo (University of Oslo Oslo, Oslo, Norway)Date Acquired March 20, 2019 Publication Date February 25, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 46 Issue: 5 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081871Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN66580Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NNX15AT34A CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF-1352417Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.Document ID 20140017663 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014Authors Jiao, C.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the Arctic Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of Arctic Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.Document ID 20140006607 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011GL050052Authors Farrell, Sinead Louise (Maryland Univ.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.Document ID 20160000353 Document Type Presentation Authors Orbe, Clara (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Newman, Paul A.

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of Arctic stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the Arctic using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the Arctic between 1995 and 2015.Document ID 20205004491 Document Type Presentation Authors U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.Document ID 20220009666 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2021GL097373&file=2021GL097373-sup-0001-Supporting+Information+SI-S01.pdfAuthors Ivy Tran (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Donifan Barahona (Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland, United States) Quentin Coopman (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada)Date Acquired June 22, 2022 Publication Date January 31, 2022 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 49 Issue: 4 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: 10.1029/2021GL097373Subject CategoryGeophysicsFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.04.03.28 CONTRACT_GRANT: NASA  80NSSC18K1599Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

CARVE bridges critical gaps in our knowledge and understanding of Arctic ecosystems, linkages between the Arctic hydrologic and terrestrial carbon cycles, and the feedbacks from fires and thawing permafrost. CARVE's objectives are to: (1) Directly test hypotheses attributing the mobilization of vulnerable Arctic carbon reservoirs to climate warming; (2) Deliver the first direct measurements and detailed maps of CO2 and CH4 sources on regional scales in the Alaskan Arctic; and (3) Demonstrate new remote sensing and modeling capabilities to quantify feedbacks between carbon fluxes and carbon cycle-climate processes in the Arctic (Figure 1).

Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\n\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.Document ID 20160003310 Document Type Presentation Authors Zamora, Lauren  (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Kahn, R.

In the Arctic, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in Arctic research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the Arctic. Recent trends in Arctic surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and Arctic glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the Arctic Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent Arctic change and provide a context for future scenarios.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.Document ID 20140008934 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011JC007257Authors Johnson, Mark (Alaska Univ.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.Document ID 20230001741 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors I.V.

Technical Review External Peer Committee KeywordsWildfireArcticRussiaClimate changeAdaptationSystematic reviewcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsReviews and syntheses: Arctic fire regimes and emissions in the 21st centuryIn recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.Document ID 20210021735 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplementAuthors Jessica L.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.Document ID 20190027361 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Camilla Weum Stjern (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Marianne Tronstad Lund (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Bjorn Hallvard Samset (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Gunnar Myhre (Center for International Climate and Environmental Research Oslo, Norway) Piers M Forster  (University of Leeds Leeds, United Kingdom)Et alDate Acquired July 17, 2019 Publication Date June 10, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 124 Issue: 13 ISSN: 2169-897X URL: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029726?af=R DOI: doi:10.1029/2018JD029726Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN69756Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/N006038/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 229771 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC nn2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K500872/1 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15K12190 CONTRACT_GRANT: JSPS 15H01728 CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC ns2345k CONTRACT_GRANT: NRC 207711/E10 CONTRACT_GRANT: UK BEIZ/DMOHCCP GA01101 CONTRACT_GRANT: NERC NE/K007483/1Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.Document ID 20170011215 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.Document ID 20205007200 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-9yp5-6p27Authors Cheng Zheng (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Yutian Wu (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Mingfang Ting (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Clara Orbe (Goddard Institute for Space Studies New York, New York, United States) Xinyue Wang (National Center for Atmospheric Research Boulder, Colorado, United States)Et alDate Acquired September 3, 2020 Publication Date February 1, 2021 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 126 Issue: 4 ISSN: 2169-897X DOI: 10.1029/2020JD033811Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.31.04.14  CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF OPP‐1825858 CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF AGS‐1802248Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.Document ID 20170012176 Document Type Presentation Authors Cullather, Richard  (Maryland Univ.

Keywords Surface TemperaturArcticcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetailsProcess drivers, inter-model spread, and a path forward: What do we know about Arctic Amplification?Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the Arctic resulting from enhanced surface warming in the Arctic relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called Arctic Amplification. While surface-based amplification of Arctic warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to Arctic Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in Arctic Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving Arctic Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected Arctic climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the Arctic lapse rate feedback.Document ID 20205010055 Document Type Presentation Authors Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.Document ID 20210011823 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Eric Stofferahn (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Joshua B Fisher (Jet Propulsion Lab La Cañada Flintridge, California, United States) Daniel J Hayes (University of Maine Orono, Maine, United States) Christopher R Schwalm (Woods Hole Research Center Falmouth, Massachusetts, United States) Deborah N Huntzinger (Northern Arizona University Flagstaff, Arizona, United States)Et alDate Acquired March 23, 2021 Publication Date May 1, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Environmental Research Letters Volume: 14 Issue: 5 DOI: 10.1088/1748-9326/ab10faSubject CategoryEarth Resources And Remote SensingFunding Number(s) WBS: 304029.01.20.04.01.02 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC19M0113 CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NM0018D0004P00002 CONTRACT_GRANT: GBMF5439 CONTRACT_GRANT: DOE-ERKP818Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.Document ID 20190001702 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) Authors Ivy Tan (University of Maryland, Baltimore County Baltimore, Maryland, United States) Trude Storelvmo (University of Oslo Oslo, Oslo, Norway)Date Acquired March 20, 2019 Publication Date February 25, 2019 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 46 Issue: 5 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: doi.org/10.1029/2018GL081871Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyReport/Patent NumberGSFC-E-DAA-TN66580Funding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: NNX15AT34A CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF-1352417Distribution Limits Public Copyright Use by or on behalf of the US Gov.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.Document ID 20140017663 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014Authors Jiao, C.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the Arctic Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of Arctic Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.Document ID 20140006607 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.1029/2011GL050052Authors Farrell, Sinead Louise (Maryland Univ.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.Document ID 20160000353 Document Type Presentation Authors Orbe, Clara (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Newman, Paul A.

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of Arctic stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the Arctic using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the Arctic between 1995 and 2015.Document ID 20205004491 Document Type Presentation Authors U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.Document ID 20220009666 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1029%2F2021GL097373&file=2021GL097373-sup-0001-Supporting+Information+SI-S01.pdfAuthors Ivy Tran (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada) Donifan Barahona (Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, Maryland, United States) Quentin Coopman (McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada)Date Acquired June 22, 2022 Publication Date January 31, 2022 Publication InformationPublication: Geophysical Research Letters Volume: 49 Issue: 4 ISSN: 0094-8276 DOI: 10.1029/2021GL097373Subject CategoryGeophysicsFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.04.03.28 CONTRACT_GRANT: NASA  80NSSC18K1599Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

KeywordsARCTICANTARCTICAGEOMAGNETIC PULSATIONDocument InquiryDetailsEvaluation of Arctic Warming in Mid-Pliocene Climate SimulationsPalaeoclimate simulations improve our understanding of the climate, inform us about the performance of climate models in a different climate scenario, and help to identify robust features of the climate system. Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\n\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

Surface features in the sea ice cover are detected using a newly developed surface feature picking algorithm. We derive information regarding the height, volume and geometry of surface features from 2009-2014 within the Beaufort/Chukchi and Central Arctic regions. The results are delineated by ice type to estimate the topographic variability across first-year and multi-year ice regimes.Document ID 20170003146 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/tc-10-1161-2016Authors Petty, Alek  (Maryland Univ.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.Document ID 20160003310 Document Type Presentation Authors Zamora, Lauren  (Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States) Kahn, R.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.Document ID 20230001741 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors I.V.

Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.Document ID 20210021735 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplementAuthors Jessica L.

In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification.

As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.Document ID 20205007200 Document Type Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) External Source(s)https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-9yp5-6p27Authors Cheng Zheng (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Yutian Wu (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Mingfang Ting (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Sparkill, New York, United States) Clara Orbe (Goddard Institute for Space Studies New York, New York, United States) Xinyue Wang (National Center for Atmospheric Research Boulder, Colorado, United States)Et alDate Acquired September 3, 2020 Publication Date February 1, 2021 Publication InformationPublication: Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres Volume: 126 Issue: 4 ISSN: 2169-897X DOI: 10.1029/2020JD033811Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) WBS: 281945.02.31.04.14  CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF OPP‐1825858 CONTRACT_GRANT: NSF AGS‐1802248Distribution Limits Public Copyright Portions of document may include copyright protected material.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends.

Keywords Surface TemperaturArcticcloud_downloadcontent_copyDetails', 'Understanding Arctic Surface Temperature Differences in ReanalysesReanalyses in the Arctic are widely used for model evaluation and for understanding contemporary climate change. Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.Document ID 20140017663 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) External Source(s)doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014Authors Jiao, C.

Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\n\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.', 'Arctic', 'Arctic', 'Arctic', 'Arctic', 'Arctic', 'Arctic', 'Arctic', 'Arctic', 'Document ID 20205010552 Document Type Reprint (Version printed in journal) Authors Wesley de Nooijer (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden)  Qiong Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Qiang Zhang (Stockholm University Stockholm, Sweden) Xiangyu Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, Beijing, China) Chuncheng Guo (Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research Bergen, Norway)Et alDate Acquired November 23, 2020 Publication Date November 23, 2020 Publication InformationPublication: Climate of the Past  Volume: 16 Issue: 6 ISSN: 1814-9324 DOI: 10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020Subject CategoryMeteorology And ClimatologyFunding Number(s) CONTRACT_GRANT: 80NSSC17M0057 WBS: Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2)Distribution Limits Public Copyright Public Use Permitted.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth.

compared with estimates of sea ice thickness derived from pan-Arctic satellite freeboard measurements (2004-2008); airborne electromagnetic measurements (2001-2009); ice draft data from moored instruments in Fram Strait, the Greenland Sea, and the Beaufort Sea (1992-2008) and from submarines (1975-2000); and drill hole data from the Arctic basin, Laptev, and East Siberian marginal seas (1982-1986) and coastal stations (1998-2009). Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.&q;,&q;isLessonsLearned&q;:false,&q;disseminated&q;:&q;DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA&q;,&q;publications&q;:[{&q;volume&q;:&q;117&q;,&q;submissionId&q;:20140008934,&q;issue&q;:&q;C8&q;,&q;publisher&q;:&q;American Geophysical Union (AGU)&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;7387e94a94ec43b5be7a2566b5ce9a51&q;,&q;publicationName&q;:&q;Journal of Geophysical Research&q;,&q;publicationDate&q;:&q;2012-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;}],&q;status&q;:&q;CURATED&q;,&q;related&q;:[],&q;downloads&q;:[{&q;draft&q;:false,&q;mimetype&q;:&q;application/pdf&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;20140008934.pdf&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;STI&q;,&q;links&q;:{&q;original&q;:&q;/api/citations/20140008934/downloads/20140008934.pdf&q;,&q;pdf&q;:&q;/api/citations/20140008934/downloads/20140008934.pdf&q;,&q;fulltext&q;:&q;/api/citations/20140008934/downloads/20140008934.txt&q;}}],&q;downloadsAvailable&q;:true,&q;index&q;:&q;submissions-2023-03-03-06-38&q;},{&q;_meta&q;:{&q;highlight&q;:{&q;abstract&q;:[&q;A scientific consensus acknowledges that climate change has increased wildfire activity in the Russian &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;, a trend projected to continue in response to further warming.

Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-&l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; have consequences for &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-&l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; fire regimes include underestimation of &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes.

Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.\\\\n&q;,&q;isLessonsLearned&q;:false,&q;disseminated&q;:&q;DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA&q;,&q;cui&q;:{},&q;publications&q;:[{&q;volume&q;:&q;18&q;,&q;submissionId&q;:20210021735,&q;issue&q;:&q;18&q;,&q;issn&q;:&q;1726-4170&q;,&q;publisher&q;:&q;Biogeosciences&q;,&q;eissn&q;:&q;1726-4189&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;ae715c78291f43e392beef05b90da1eb&q;,&q;publicationName&q;:&q;European Geosciences Union&q;,&q;publicationDate&q;:&q;2021-09-15T04:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;issuePublicationDate&q;:&q;2021-09-15T04:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;doi&q;:&q;https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021&q;}],&q;status&q;:&q;CURATED&q;,&q;related&q;:[],&q;downloads&q;:[{&q;draft&q;:false,&q;mimetype&q;:&q;application/pdf&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;bg-18-5053-2021-supplement.pdf&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;OTHER&q;,&q;links&q;:{&q;original&q;:&q;/api/citations/20210021735/downloads/bg-18-5053-2021-supplement.pdf&q;,&q;pdf&q;:&q;/api/citations/20210021735/downloads/bg-18-5053-2021-supplement.pdf&q;,&q;fulltext&q;:&q;/api/citations/20210021735/downloads/bg-18-5053-2021-supplement.pdf.txt&q;}},{&q;draft&q;:false,&q;mimetype&q;:&q;application/pdf&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;bg-18-5053-2021.pdf&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;STI&q;,&q;links&q;:{&q;original&q;:&q;/api/citations/20210021735/downloads/bg-18-5053-2021.pdf&q;,&q;pdf&q;:&q;/api/citations/20210021735/downloads/bg-18-5053-2021.pdf&q;,&q;fulltext&q;:&q;/api/citations/20210021735/downloads/bg-18-5053-2021.pdf.txt&q;}}],&q;downloadsAvailable&q;:true,&q;index&q;:&q;submissions-2023-03-03-06-38&q;},{&q;_meta&q;:{&q;highlight&q;:{&q;abstract&q;:[&q;The &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; is experiencing rapid climate change in response to changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols and other climate drivers. Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; amplification (defined as the ratio between &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;, with a seasonality following that of the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.&q;],&q;title&q;:[&q;&l;em

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification (defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.&q;,&q;isLessonsLearned&q;:false,&q;disseminated&q;:&q;DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA&q;,&q;publications&q;:[{&q;volume&q;:&q;124&q;,&q;submissionId&q;:20190027361,&q;issue&q;:&q;13&q;,&q;issn&q;:&q;2169-897X&q;,&q;publisher&q;:&q;American Geophysical Union&q;,&q;eissn&q;:&q;2169-8996&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;e1103e4ccbcc456cb6b0e176fd88f412&q;,&q;publicationName&q;:&q;Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres&q;,&q;publicationDate&q;:&q;2019-06-10T04:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;issuePublicationDate&q;:&q;2019-07-16T04:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029726?af=R&q;,&q;doi&q;:&q;doi:10.1029/2018JD029726&q;}],&q;status&q;:&q;CURATED&q;,&q;related&q;:[],&q;downloads&q;:[{&q;draft&q;:false,&q;mimetype&q;:&q;application/pdf&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;20190027361.pdf&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;STI&q;,&q;links&q;:{&q;original&q;:&q;/api/citations/20190027361/downloads/20190027361.pdf&q;,&q;pdf&q;:&q;/api/citations/20190027361/downloads/20190027361.pdf&q;,&q;fulltext&q;:&q;/api/citations/20190027361/downloads/20190027361.txt&q;}}],&q;downloadsAvailable&q;:true,&q;index&q;:&q;submissions-2023-03-03-06-38&q;},{&q;_meta&q;:{&q;highlight&q;:{&q;abstract&q;:[&q;The strength of the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; lower stratospheric polar vortex is examined for the last 1 &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; Winters.&q;],&q;title&q;:[&q;The Anomalous &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; Lower Stratospheric Polar Vortex of 1992-1993&q;]},&q;score&q;:121.2755},&q;copyright&q;:{&q;licenseType&q;:&q;NO&q;,&q;approverComments&q;:&q;Items in TRS are protected by copyright, but are furnished with U.S. government purpose use rights.&q;,&q;containsIndication&q;:true,&q;belongsToPublisher&q;:true,&q;determinationType&q;:&q;OTHER&q;,&q;thirdPartyContentCondition&q;:&q;NOT_SET&q;},&q;keywords&q;:[&q;arctic&q;,&q;arctic&q;,&q;stratosphere&q;,&q;polar&q;,&q;vortex&q;,&q;vortex&q;],&q;exportControl&q;:{&q;isExportControl&q;:&q;UNSET&q;,&q;ear&q;:&q;UNSET&q;,&q;itar&q;:&q;UNSET&q;},&q;created&q;:&q;1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;distributionDate&q;:&q;1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;center&q;:{&q;code&q;:&q;JPL&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;efbc9c123a0f47caafa95d99b7d2e1a1&q;},&q;onlyAbstract&q;:false,&q;sensitiveInformation&q;:0,&q;abstract&q;:&q;The strength of the Arctic lower stratospheric polar vortex is examined for the last 1 Arctic Winters.&q;,&q;title&q;:&q;The Anomalous Arctic Lower Stratospheric Polar Vortex of 1992-1993&q;,&q;stiType&q;:&q;OTHER&q;,&q;distribution&q;:&q;PUBLIC&q;,&q;authorAffiliations&q;:[{&q;sequence&q;:0,&q;submissionId&q;:20210004199,&q;meta&q;:{&q;author&q;:{&q;name&q;:&q;[&s;Manney, G.L.&s;, &s;Zurek, R.W.&s;, &s;Gelman, M.E.&s;, &s;Miller, A.J.&s;, &s;Nagatani, R.&s;]&q;}},&q;id&q;:&q;a9621ac9e1494633b72c49d9358b3ffa&q;}],&q;disseminated&q;:&q;METADATA_ONLY&q;,&q;stiTypeDetails&q;:&q;Other&q;,&q;technicalReviewType&q;:&q;NOT_SET&q;,&q;modified&q;:&q;2023-02-03T05:36:20.9117960+00:00&q;,&q;id&q;:20210004199,&q;sourceIdentifiers&q;:[{&q;number&q;:&q;2014/33149&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;HANDLE&q;}],&q;publications&q;:[{&q;submissionId&q;:20210004199,&q;publisher&q;:&q;UNKNOWN&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;4b36470acbb14af39f3f15cf95fd2c97&q;,&q;publicationDate&q;:&q;1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;}],&q;status&q;:&q;CURATED&q;,&q;related&q;:[],&q;downloads&q;:[],&q;downloadsAvailable&q;:false,&q;index&q;:&q;submissions-2023-03-03-06-38&q;},{&q;_meta&q;:{&q;highlight&q;:{&q;abstract&q;:[&q;Reanalyses in the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; are widely used for model evaluation and for understanding contemporary climate change. Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; surfaces, including the central &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends.

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.&q;,&q;isLessonsLearned&q;:false,&q;disseminated&q;:&q;DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA&q;,&q;meetings&q;:[{&q;country&q;:&q;United States&q;,&q;submissionId&q;:20170012176,&q;endDate&q;:&q;2017-12-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;sponsors&q;:[{&q;meta&q;:{&q;organization&q;:{&q;name&q;:&q;American Geophysical Union&q;,&q;location&q;:&q;Washington, DC, United States&q;}},&q;meetingId&q;:&q;d798c0362f0d40bdabf425f17ee082ac&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;3e2ea8bd7a0e4851aa42df8ae53f872e&q;}],&q;name&q;:&q;AGU Fall Meeting&q;,&q;location&q;:&q;New Orleans, LA&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;d798c0362f0d40bdabf425f17ee082ac&q;,&q;startDate&q;:&q;2017-12-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;}],&q;publications&q;:[{&q;submissionId&q;:20170012176,&q;id&q;:&q;19f45c68845b4adb87a73845ac2d3c51&q;,&q;publicationDate&q;:&q;2017-12-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;}],&q;status&q;:&q;CURATED&q;,&q;related&q;:[],&q;downloads&q;:[{&q;draft&q;:false,&q;mimetype&q;:&q;application/pdf&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;20170012176.pdf&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;STI&q;,&q;links&q;:{&q;original&q;:&q;/api/citations/20170012176/downloads/20170012176.pdf&q;,&q;pdf&q;:&q;/api/citations/20170012176/downloads/20170012176.pdf&q;,&q;fulltext&q;:&q;/api/citations/20170012176/downloads/20170012176.txt&q;}}],&q;downloadsAvailable&q;:true,&q;index&q;:&q;submissions-2023-03-03-06-38&q;},{&q;_meta&q;:{&q;highlight&q;:{&q;abstract&q;:[&q;Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; resulting from enhanced surface warming in the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; Amplification.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become

integrates field and airborne data into modeling and synthesis activities for understanding Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics. The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of Arctic-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.&q;,&q;isLessonsLearned&q;:false,&q;disseminated&q;:&q;DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA&q;,&q;cui&q;:{},&q;publications&q;:[{&q;volume&q;:&q;14&q;,&q;submissionId&q;:20210011823,&q;issue&q;:&q;5&q;,&q;publisher&q;:&q;IOP Publishing&q;,&q;eissn&q;:&q;1748-9326&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;28304e653d2947f981a15f65d67a2b1e&q;,&q;publicationName&q;:&q;Environmental Research Letters&q;,&q;publicationDate&q;:&q;2019-05-01T04:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;issuePublicationDate&q;:&q;2019-05-01T04:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;url&q;:&q;&q;,&q;doi&q;:&q;10.1088/1748-9326/ab10fa&q;}],&q;status&q;:&q;CURATED&q;,&q;related&q;:[],&q;downloads&q;:[{&q;draft&q;:false,&q;mimetype&q;:&q;application/pdf&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;20210011823 the arctic boreal vulnerability experiment paper.pdf&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;STI&q;,&q;links&q;:{&q;original&q;:&q;/api/citations/20210011823/downloads/20210011823%20the%20arctic%20boreal%20vulnerability%20experiment%20paper.pdf&q;,&q;pdf&q;:&q;/api/citations/20210011823/downloads/20210011823%20the%20arctic%20boreal%20vulnerability%20experiment%20paper.pdf&q;,&q;fulltext&q;:&q;/api/citations/20210011823/downloads/20210011823%20the%20arctic%20boreal%20vulnerability%20experiment%20paper.pdf.txt&q;}}],&q;downloadsAvailable&q;:true,&q;index&q;:&q;submissions-2023-03-03-06-38&q;},{&q;_meta&q;:{&q;highlight&q;:{&q;abstract&q;:[&q;Underestimation of the proportion of supercooled liquid in mixed‐phase clouds in climate models has called into question its impact on &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; climate change.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; snow include &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; BC emissions, transport of extra-&l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; BC deposition originates from extra-&l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;, we obtain a multi-model mean &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;.&q;],&q;title&q;:[&q;An AeroCom Assessment of Black Carbon in &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; Snow and Sea Ice&q;]},&q;score&q;:113.86201},&q;copyright&q;:{&q;licenseType&q;:&q;NO&q;,&q;determinationType&q;:&q;PUBLIC_USE_PERMITTED&q;,&q;thirdPartyContentCondition&q;:&q;NOT_SET&q;},&q;subjectCategories&q;:[&q;Meteorology And Climatology&q;],&q;keywords&q;:[&q;carbon&q;,&q;bias&q;,&q;aerosols&q;,&q;Arctic regions&q;,&q;deposition&q;,&q;sea ice&q;,&q;snow&q;],&q;exportControl&q;:{&q;isExportControl&q;:&q;NO&q;,&q;ear&q;:&q;NO&q;,&q;itar&q;:&q;NO&q;},&q;distributionDate&q;:&q;2019-07-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;otherReportNumbers&q;:[&q;GSFC-E-DAA-TN17471&q;],&q;fundingNumbers&q;:[{&q;number&q;:&q;NNX09AK32G&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;CONTRACT_GRANT&q;},{&q;number&q;:&q;NNX14AB99A&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;CONTRACT_GRANT&q;}],&q;title&q;:&q;An AeroCom Assessment of Black Carbon in Arctic Snow and Sea Ice&q;,&q;stiType&q;:&q;REPRINT&q;,&q;distribution&q;:&q;PUBLIC&q;,&q;submittedDate&q;:&q;2014-12-22T13:10:10.6370000+00:00&q;,&q;authorAffiliations&q;:[{&q;sequence&q;:0,&q;submissionId&q;:20140017663,&q;meta&q;:{&q;author&q;:{&q;name&q;:&q;Jiao, C.&q;},&q;organization&q;:{&q;name&q;:&q;Michigan Univ.&q;,&q;location&q;:&q;Ann Arbor, MI, United States&q;}},&q;id&q;:&q;14ca5370aa1640b0905a044c6e1b0d07&q;},{&q;sequence&q;:1,&q;submissionId&q;:20140017663,&q;meta&q;:{&q;author&q;:{&q;name&q;:&q;Flanner, M.

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic. &q;,&q;isLessonsLearned&q;:false,&q;disseminated&q;:&q;DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA&q;,&q;publications&q;:[{&q;volume&q;:&q;14&q;,&q;submissionId&q;:20140017663,&q;issue&q;:&q;5&q;,&q;publisher&q;:&q;Copernicus&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;044127ecb6ec4b2899830a6a6efbdceb&q;,&q;publicationName&q;:&q;Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics&q;,&q;publicationDate&q;:&q;2014-03-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;}],&q;status&q;:&q;CURATED&q;,&q;related&q;:[],&q;downloads&q;:[{&q;draft&q;:false,&q;mimetype&q;:&q;application/pdf&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;20140017663.pdf&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;STI&q;,&q;links&q;:{&q;original&q;:&q;/api/citations/20140017663/downloads/20140017663.pdf&q;,&q;pdf&q;:&q;/api/citations/20140017663/downloads/20140017663.pdf&q;,&q;fulltext&q;:&q;/api/citations/20140017663/downloads/20140017663.txt&q;}}],&q;downloadsAvailable&q;:true,&q;index&q;:&q;submissions-2023-03-03-06-38&q;},{&q;_meta&q;:{&q;highlight&q;:{&q;abstract&q;:[&q;ICESat and Envisat altimetry data provide measurements of the instantaneous sea surface height (SSH) across the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; Ocean, using lead and open water elevation within the sea ice pack.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (&l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; air, or air of &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.&q;,&q;isLessonsLearned&q;:false,&q;disseminated&q;:&q;DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA&q;,&q;meetings&q;:[{&q;country&q;:&q;United States&q;,&q;submissionId&q;:20160000353,&q;endDate&q;:&q;2014-12-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;sponsors&q;:[{&q;meta&q;:{&q;organization&q;:{&q;name&q;:&q;American Geophysical Union&q;,&q;location&q;:&q;Washington, DC, United States&q;}},&q;meetingId&q;:&q;9de5aebd9a2b4de4828b26e6f6d8cd64&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;ddd6ba964e75493f8f48bbd8b29cb213&q;}],&q;name&q;:&q;AGU Fall Meeting 2014&q;,&q;location&q;:&q;San Francisco, CA&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;9de5aebd9a2b4de4828b26e6f6d8cd64&q;,&q;startDate&q;:&q;2014-12-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;}],&q;publications&q;:[{&q;submissionId&q;:20160000353,&q;id&q;:&q;65e0d094a1be407689955e7e143f8ff0&q;,&q;publicationDate&q;:&q;2014-12-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;}],&q;status&q;:&q;CURATED&q;,&q;related&q;:[],&q;downloads&q;:[{&q;draft&q;:false,&q;mimetype&q;:&q;application/pdf&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;20160000353.pdf&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;STI&q;,&q;links&q;:{&q;original&q;:&q;/api/citations/20160000353/downloads/20160000353.pdf&q;,&q;pdf&q;:&q;/api/citations/20160000353/downloads/20160000353.pdf&q;,&q;fulltext&q;:&q;/api/citations/20160000353/downloads/20160000353.txt&q;}}],&q;downloadsAvailable&q;:true,&q;index&q;:&q;submissions-2023-03-03-06-38&q;},{&q;_meta&q;:{&q;highlight&q;:{&q;abstract&q;:[&q;The &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) is currently assessing the impacts of Short-Lived Climate Forcers (SLCF) on &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; climate and air quality. In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations.

Here, we analyse &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\\\n\\\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; warming in the mPWP to projections of future &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.&q;],&q;title&q;:[&q;Evaluation of &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; Warming in Mid-Pliocene Climate

the climate, inform us about the performance of climate models in a different climate scenario, and help to identify robust features of the climate system. Here, we analyse Arctic warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\\\\n\\\\nThe PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic (60–90∘\\u2009N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6\\u2009∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2\\u2009∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\\\\n\\u2009km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106\\u2009km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53\\u2009% compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106\\u2009km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.&q;,&q;isLessonsLearned&q;:false,&q;disseminated&q;:&q;DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA&q;,&q;publications&q;:[{&q;volume&q;:&q;16&q;,&q;submissionId&q;:20205010552,&q;issue&q;:&q;6&q;,&q;issn&q;:&q;1814-9324&q;,&q;publisher&q;:&q;Copernicus / European Geophysical Union&q;,&q;eissn&q;:&q;1814-9332&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;0099b0b6c2a64fb6bfdcb3d2900fc844&q;,&q;publicationName&q;:&q;Climate of the Past &q;,&q;publicationDate&q;:&q;2020-11-23T05:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;doi&q;:&q;10.5194/cp-16-2325-2020&q;}],&q;status&q;:&q;CURATED&q;,&q;related&q;:[],&q;downloads&q;:[{&q;draft&q;:false,&q;mimetype&q;:&q;application/pdf&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;LSohlClimPastEvaluationReprint.pdf&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;STI&q;,&q;links&q;:{&q;original&q;:&q;/api/citations/20205010552/downloads/LSohlClimPastEvaluationReprint.pdf&q;,&q;pdf&q;:&q;/api/citations/20205010552/downloads/LSohlClimPastEvaluationReprint.pdf&q;,&q;fulltext&q;:&q;/api/citations/20205010552/downloads/LSohlClimPastEvaluationReprint.pdf.txt&q;}},{&q;draft&q;:false,&q;mimetype&q;:&q;application/pdf&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;LSohlClimPastEvaluationSuppReprint.pdf&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;STI&q;,&q;links&q;:{&q;original&q;:&q;/api/citations/20205010552/downloads/LSohlClimPastEvaluationSuppReprint.pdf&q;,&q;pdf&q;:&q;/api/citations/20205010552/downloads/LSohlClimPastEvaluationSuppReprint.pdf&q;,&q;fulltext&q;:&q;/api/citations/20205010552/downloads/LSohlClimPastEvaluationSuppReprint.pdf.txt&q;}}],&q;downloadsAvailable&q;:true,&q;index&q;:&q;submissions-2023-03-03-06-38&q;},{&q;_meta&q;:{&q;highlight&q;:{&q;abstract&q;:[&q;We present an analysis of &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; sea ice topography using high resolution, three-dimensional, surface elevation data from the Airborne Topographic Mapper, flown as part of NASA&s;s Operation IceBridge mission.

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g; smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the &l;em class=\\\\&q;hlt1\\\\&q;&g;Arctic&l;/em&g;.

However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.&q;,&q;isLessonsLearned&q;:false,&q;disseminated&q;:&q;DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA&q;,&q;meetings&q;:[{&q;country&q;:&q;United States&q;,&q;submissionId&q;:20160003310,&q;endDate&q;:&q;2016-01-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;,&q;sponsors&q;:[{&q;meta&q;:{&q;organization&q;:{&q;name&q;:&q;American Meteorological Society&q;,&q;location&q;:&q;Washington, DC, United States&q;}},&q;meetingId&q;:&q;0217731fe3a54999a4a35c79c614e99f&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;cd34e373439340c7bfe4183a1cede577&q;}],&q;name&q;:&q;American Meteorological Society Annual Meeting&q;,&q;location&q;:&q;New Orleans, LA&q;,&q;id&q;:&q;0217731fe3a54999a4a35c79c614e99f&q;,&q;startDate&q;:&q;2016-01-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;}],&q;publications&q;:[{&q;submissionId&q;:20160003310,&q;id&q;:&q;9d592eef296843e78ae44bfa59085bde&q;,&q;publicationDate&q;:&q;2016-01-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00&q;}],&q;status&q;:&q;CURATED&q;,&q;related&q;:[{&q;disseminated&q;:&q;METADATA_ONLY&q;,&q;id&q;:20160002954,&q;type&q;:&q;SEE_ALSO&q;,&q;title&q;:&q;Aircraft-Measured Indirect Cloud Effects from Biomass Burning Smoke in the Arctic and Subarctic&q;,&q;stiType&q;:&q;REPRINT&q;,&q;distribution&q;:&q;PUBLIC&q;,&q;status&q;:&q;CURATED&q;}],&q;downloads&q;:[{&q;draft&q;:false,&q;mimetype&q;:&q;application/pdf&q;,&q;name&q;:&q;20160003310.pdf&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;STI&q;,&q;links&q;:{&q;original&q;:&q;/api/citations/20160003310/downloads/20160003310.pdf&q;,&q;pdf&q;:&q;/api/citations/20160003310/downloads/20160003310.pdf&q;,&q;fulltext&q;:&q;/api/citations/20160003310/downloads/20160003310.txt&q;}}],&q;downloadsAvailable&q;:true,&q;index&q;:&q;submissions-2023-03-03-06-38&q;}],&q;aggregations&q;:{&q;created&q;:{&q;buckets&q;:[{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;2013&q;,&q;key&q;:1356998400000,&q;doc_count&q;:5898},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;2023&q;,&q;key&q;:1672531200000,&q;doc_count&q;:368},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;2014&q;,&q;key&q;:1388534400000,&q;doc_count&q;:260},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;2021&q;,&q;key&q;:1609459200000,&q;doc_count&q;:245},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;2020&q;,&q;key&q;:1577836800000,&q;doc_count&q;:243},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;2019&q;,&q;key&q;:1546300800000,&q;doc_count&q;:242},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;2018&q;,&q;key&q;:1514764800000,&q;doc_count&q;:213},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;2017&q;,&q;key&q;:1483228800000,&q;doc_count&q;:157},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;2022&q;,&q;key&q;:1640995200000,&q;doc_count&q;:156},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;2015&q;,&q;key&q;:1420070400000,&q;doc_count&q;:142},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;2016&q;,&q;key&q;:1451606400000,&q;doc_count&q;:120},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;1995&q;,&q;key&q;:788918400000,&q;doc_count&q;:4},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;1994&q;,&q;key&q;:757382400000,&q;doc_count&q;:3},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;1996&q;,&q;key&q;:820454400000,&q;doc_count&q;:2},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;1998&q;,&q;key&q;:883612800000,&q;doc_count&q;:2},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;1993&q;,&q;key&q;:725846400000,&q;doc_count&q;:1},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;1997&q;,&q;key&q;:852076800000,&q;doc_count&q;:1},{&q;key_as_string&q;:&q;1999&q;,&q;key&q;:915148800000,&q;doc_count&q;:1}]},&q;author&q;:{&q;doc_count_error_upper_bound&q;:32,&q;sum_other_doc_count&q;:33694,&q;buckets&q;:[{&q;key&q;:&q;Newman, Paul A.&q;,&q;doc_count&q;:51},{&q;key&q;:&q;Comiso, Josefino C.&q;,&q;doc_count&q;:48},{&q;key&q;:&q;Kwok, R.&q;,&q;doc_count&q;:44},{&q;key&q;:&q;Parkinson, Claire L.&q;,&q;doc_count&q;:38},{&q;key&q;:&q;Pawson, Steven&q;,&q;doc_count&q;:38},{&q;key&q;:&q;Markus, Thorsten&q;,&q;doc_count&q;:37},{&q;key&q;:&q;Cavalieri, Donald J.&q;,&q;doc_count&q;:36},{&q;key&q;:&q;Newman, P.

In the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. Recent trends in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> change and provide a context for future scenarios. We further quantify uncertainties in key reanalyses variables and approaches for addressing these issues.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20190031804 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Poster </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-5\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Andrews, Lauren C. <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, MD, United States)</em><!-- --></span></div></mat-chip-list><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-6\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Cullather, Richard I. <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Maryland Univ.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20140008934 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Reprint (Version printed in journal) </div></div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">External Source(s)</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><!-- --><a _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1029/2011JC007257\" target=\"_blank\">doi:10.1029/2011JC007257</a><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><!-- --></div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-13\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Johnson, Mark <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Alaska Univ.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20230001741 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Reprint (Version printed in journal) </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-22\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> I.V.

Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> have consequences for <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fire regimes include underestimation of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> communities.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20210021735 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) </div></div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">External Source(s)</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><!-- --><a _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplement\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplement</a><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><!-- --></div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-31\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Jessica L.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification (defined as the ratio between <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, with a seasonality following that of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> surfaces, including the central <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20170011215 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Presentation </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-53\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Cullather, Richard  <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Maryland Univ.

As most <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> following the isentropic surfaces.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20170012176 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Presentation </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-82\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Cullather, Richard  <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Maryland Univ.

While surface-based amplification of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> snow include <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> BC emissions, transport of extra-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> BC deposition originates from extra-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, we obtain a multi-model mean <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20140017663 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Reprint (Version printed in journal) </div></div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">External Source(s)</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><!-- --><a _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014\" target=\"_blank\">doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014</a><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><!-- --></div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-109\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Jiao, C. <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Michigan Univ.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20140006607 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Reprint (Version printed in journal) </div></div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">External Source(s)</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><!-- --><a _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1029/2011GL050052\" target=\"_blank\">doi:10.1029/2011GL050052</a><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><!-- --></div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-119\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Farrell, Sinead Louise <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Maryland Univ.

Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, (<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> air, or air of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> origin). By comparison, approx. 63% of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, (midlatitude air). Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> between 1995 and 2015.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20205004491 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Presentation </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-138\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to &gt;2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

CARVE bridges critical gaps in our knowledge and understanding of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> ecosystems, linkages between the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> hydrologic and terrestrial carbon cycles, and the feedbacks from fires and thawing permafrost. CARVE's objectives are to: (1) Directly test hypotheses attributing the mobilization of vulnerable <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> carbon reservoirs to climate warming; (2) Deliver the first direct measurements and detailed maps of CO2 and CH4 sources on regional scales in the Alaskan <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>; and (3) Demonstrate new remote sensing and modeling capabilities to quantify feedbacks between carbon fluxes and carbon cycle-climate processes in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> (Figure 1). We describe the investigation design and results from 2011 test flights in Alaska.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20150008711 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Conference Paper </div></div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">External Source(s)</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><!-- --><!-- --><a _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" href=\"https://hdl.handle.net/hdl:2014/44930\" target=\"_blank\">hdl:2014/44930</a><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><!-- --></div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-158\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Miller, Charles E. <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.

Here, we analyse <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\n",
       " \n",
       " The PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> (60–90∘ N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6 ∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2 ∘C. The <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\n",
       "  km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106 km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53 % compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106 km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> warming in the mPWP to projections of future <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20160003310 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Presentation </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-186\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Zamora, Lauren  <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States)</em><!-- --></span></div></mat-chip-list><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-187\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Kahn, R.

      "    Institution: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, MD, United States\n",
      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: Reanalyses are regularly gridded, retrospective depictions of the physical earth system, which are produced through the correction of a short-term forecast to available observations. In the Arctic, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3 are widely used in Arctic research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the Arctic. Recent trends in Arctic surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and Arctic glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the Arctic Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent Arctic change and provide a context for future scenarios.

      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: Six Arctic Ocean Model Intercomparison Project model simulations are compared with estimates of sea ice thickness derived from pan-Arctic satellite freeboard measurements 2004-2008; airborne electromagnetic measurements 2001-2009; ice draft data from moored instruments in Fram Strait, the Greenland Sea, and the Beaufort Sea 1992-2008 and from submarines 1975-2000; and drill hole data from the Arctic basin, Laptev, and East Siberian marginal seas 1982-1986 and coastal stations 1998-2009. Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m, the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.\n",

      "    Institution: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, MD, United States\n",
      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: A scientific consensus acknowledges that climate change has increased wildfire activity in the Russian Arctic, a trend projected to continue in response to further warming. Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans i.e. outputs to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic.\n",

      "    Title: Reviews and syntheses: Arctic fire regimes and emissions in the 21st century\n",
      "    Institution: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, MD, United States\n",
      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: In recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme AMAP Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. 1 Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural i.e. lightning and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. 2 Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. 3 To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. 4 Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. 5 What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. 6 Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.\n",

      "    Institution: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, MD, United States\n",
      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: The Arctic is experiencing rapid climate change in response to changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols and other climate drivers. Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the Arctic. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4. We show that the annual mean Arctic amplification defined as the ratio between Arctic and the global mean temperature change at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4 for the solar to 2.3 Â± 0.6 for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the Arctic is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the Arctic, with a seasonality following that of the Arctic amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.\n",

      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: Reanalyses in the Arctic are widely used for model evaluation and for understanding contemporary climate change. Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in Arctic surfaces, including the central Arctic Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central Arctic Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes i.e. 0 deg. Celsius, rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.\n",

      "    Institution: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, MD, United States\n",
      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: Trace gases and aerosols play an important role in Arctic chemistry and climate. As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway ~8 days, which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway 1~3 months, as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces.\n",

      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: Reanalyses in the Arctic are widely used for model evaluation and for understanding contemporary climate change. Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap 70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the Arctic: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the Arctic tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the Arctic Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the Arctic Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.\n",

      "    Institution: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, MD, United States\n",
      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: Over the recent decades, rapid changes have been observed in the Arctic resulting from enhanced surface warming in the Arctic relative to the rest of the globe, a phenomenon called Arctic Amplification. While surface-based amplification of Arctic warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to Arctic Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in Arctic Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving Arctic Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected Arctic climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions Arctic-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the Arctic lapse rate feedback.\n",

      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: NASA's Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment ABoVE integrates field and airborne data into modeling and synthesis activities for understanding Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics. The ABoVE Benchmarking System ABS is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of Arctic and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key Arctic indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of Arctic-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the Arctic-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions.

      "    Institution: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, MD, United States\n",
      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: Underestimation of the proportion of supercooled liquid in mixed‐phase clouds in climate models has called into question its impact on Arctic climate change. We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.\n",

      "    Institution: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, MD, United States\n",
      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: Though many global aerosols models prognose surface deposition, only a few models have been used to directly simulate the radiative effect from black carbon BC deposition to snow and sea ice. Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models AeroCom project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the Arctic. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in Arctic snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the Arctic. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean range bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 −13.2 to +10.7 ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models phase I, and +4.1 −13.0 to +21.4 ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models phase II, compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in Arctic snow include Arctic BC emissions, transport of extra-Arctic aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the Arctic, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The Arctic 60-90degN atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most Arctic BC deposition originates from extra-Arctic emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean full range of Arctic radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 0.07-0.25 W/sq m and 0.18 0.06-0.28 W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the Arctic, we obtain a multi-model mean Arctic radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the Arctic as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the Arctic.\n",

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface MSS models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography MDT of the Arctic Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of Arctic Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.\n",

      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: We present the first climatology of air mass origin in the Arctic in terms of rigorously defined air mass fractions that partition air according to where it last contacted the planetary boundary layer PBL. Results from a present-day climate integration of the GEOSCCM general circulation model reveal that the Arctic lower troposphere below 700 mb is dominated year round by air whose last PBL contact occurred poleward of 60degN, Arctic air, or air of Arctic origin. By comparison, approx. 63% of the Arctic troposphere above 700 mb originates in the NH midlatitude PBL, midlatitude air. Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the Arctic originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the Arctic last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia approx. 40 % and, to a lesser extent, in North America approx. 24%. Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.\n",

      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme AMAP is currently assessing the impacts of Short-Lived Climate Forcers SLCF on Arctic climate and air quality. In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences GISS Earth System Model modelE2.1, with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol OMA and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state MATRIX aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 CMIP6, while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate SO4, black carbon BC, organic carbon OA, and ozone O3 are compared with observations from a set of Arctic stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths AOD are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer AVHRR. The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the Arctic using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the Arctic between 1995 and 2015.\n",

      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: Arctic amplification AA is simulated by all global climate models, however the spread in the degree of projected warming is large and the underlying mechanisms driving it are poorly understood. The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle INP concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.\n",

      "The PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates Arctic 60–90∘ N annual mean surface air temperature SAT increases of 3.7 to 11.6 ∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean MMM increase of 7.2 ∘C. The Arctic warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 MMM is 2.3. Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\n",
      " km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106 km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53 % compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority 11 out of 16 of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions ≤1×106 km2 in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the Arctic when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest Arctic SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the Arctic warming in the mPWP to projections of future Arctic warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater Arctic amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation AMOC strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.\n",

      "    Institution: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, MD, United States\n",
      "    Subtitle/ Abstract: The incidence of wildfires in the Arctic and subarctic is increasing; in boreal North America, for example, the burned area is expected to increase by 200-300 over the next 50-100 years, which previous studies suggest could have a large effect on cloud microphysics, lifetime, albedo, and precipitation. However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the Arctic and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number Nliq/ and various biomass burning tracers BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and Arctic smoke aerosol-cloud interactions ACI, where ACI = 1/3 x dlnNliq/dlnBBt to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content 0.02 gm/ cu m and very high aerosol concentrations 2000-3000 cu m in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the Arctic. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.\n",

In the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. Recent trends in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> change and provide a context for future scenarios.

Despite an assessment of six models that differ in numerical methods, resolution, domain, forcing, and boundary conditions, the models generally overestimate the thickness of measured ice thinner than approximately 2 mand underestimate the thickness of ice measured thicker than about approximately 2m. In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth. Considering all observational data sets, the better correlations and smaller differences from observations are from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II and Pan-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System models.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20140008934 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Reprint (Version printed in journal) </div></div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">External Source(s)</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><!-- --><a _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1029/2011JC007257\" target=\"_blank\">doi:10.1029/2011JC007257</a><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><!-- --></div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-13\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Johnson, Mark <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Alaska Univ.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20230001741 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Reprint (Version printed in journal) </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-22\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> I.V.

Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> have consequences for <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fire regimes include underestimation of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> communities.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20210021735 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) </div></div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">External Source(s)</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><!-- --><a _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplement\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplement</a><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><!-- --></div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-31\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Jessica L.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification (defined as the ratio between <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, with a seasonality following that of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> surfaces, including the central <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20170011215 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Presentation </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-53\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Cullather, Richard  <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Maryland Univ.

As most <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> following the isentropic surfaces.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20170012176 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Presentation </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-82\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Cullather, Richard  <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Maryland Univ.

While surface-based amplification of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> lapse rate feedback.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20205010055 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Presentation </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-89\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> snow include <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> BC emissions, transport of extra-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> BC deposition originates from extra-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, we obtain a multi-model mean <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20140017663 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Reprint (Version printed in journal) </div></div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">External Source(s)</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><!-- --><a _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014\" target=\"_blank\">doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014</a><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><!-- --></div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-109\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Jiao, C. <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Michigan Univ.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20140006607 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Reprint (Version printed in journal) </div></div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">External Source(s)</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><!-- --><a _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1029/2011GL050052\" target=\"_blank\">doi:10.1029/2011GL050052</a><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><!-- --></div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-119\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Farrell, Sinead Louise <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Maryland Univ.

Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> between 1995 and 2015.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20205004491 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Presentation </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-138\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to &gt;2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

CARVE bridges critical gaps in our knowledge and understanding of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> ecosystems, linkages between the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> hydrologic and terrestrial carbon cycles, and the feedbacks from fires and thawing permafrost. CARVE's objectives are to: (1) Directly test hypotheses attributing the mobilization of vulnerable <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> carbon reservoirs to climate warming; (2) Deliver the first direct measurements and detailed maps of CO2 and CH4 sources on regional scales in the Alaskan <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>; and (3) Demonstrate new remote sensing and modeling capabilities to quantify feedbacks between carbon fluxes and carbon cycle-climate processes in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> (Figure 1).

Here, we analyse <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\n",
       " \n",
       " The PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> (60–90∘ N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6 ∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2 ∘C. The <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\n",
       "  km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106 km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53 % compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106 km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> warming in the mPWP to projections of future <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20160003310 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Presentation </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-186\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Zamora, Lauren  <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States)</em><!-- --></span></div></mat-chip-list><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-187\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Kahn, R.

In the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, reanalyses are particularly well suited to marshal the sparse observing network to provide a plausible, multivariate representation of conditions. Atmospheric reanalyses such as MERRA-2 (NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) and ocean reanalyses such as SODA3 (Univ. Maryland Simple Ocean Data Assimilation version 3) are widely used in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> research for diagnostic studies of circulation, model evaluation, and as boundary conditions for a variety of process models. Here, we provide examples that illustrate the utility of reanalyses for providing information on the spatial and temporal scales of recent, rapid changes in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. Recent trends in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> surface temperatures, surface melt over Greenland and <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> glaciers, and evolving freshwater conditions in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean are examples where reanalyses can provide information that cannot easily be obtained via other means. These examples provide information on the scale, magnitude, and the uncertainty of recent <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> change and provide a context for future scenarios. We further quantify uncertainties in key reanalyses variables and approaches for addressing these issues.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20190031804 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Poster </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-5\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Andrews, Lauren C. <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Greenbelt, MD, United States)</em><!-- --></span></div></mat-chip-list><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-6\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Cullather, Richard I. <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Maryland Univ.

In the regions of flat immobile landfast ice (shallow Siberian Seas with depths less than 25-30 m), the models generally overestimate both the total observed sea ice thickness and rates of September and October ice growth from observations by more than 4 times and more than one standard deviation, respectively. The models do not reproduce conditions of fast ice formation and growth. Instead, the modeled fast ice is replaced with pack ice which drifts, generating ridges of increasing ice thickness, in addition to thermodynamic ice growth.

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20230001741 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Reprint (Version printed in journal) </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-22\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> I.V.

Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> have consequences for <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fire regimes include underestimation of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> communities.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20210021735 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Accepted Manuscript (Version with final changes) </div></div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">External Source(s)</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><!-- --><a _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplement\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-5053-2021-supplement</a><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><!-- --></div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-31\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Jessica L.

Emission changes in general, as well as geographical shifts in emissions and transport pathways of shortlived climate forcers, make it necessary to understand the influence of each climate driver on the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. In the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project, ten global climate models perturbed five different climate drivers separately (CO2, CH4, the solar constant, BC and SO4). We show that the annual mean <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification (defined as the ratio between <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> and the global mean temperature change) at the surface is similar between climate drivers, ranging from 1.9 (Â± an intermodel standard deviation of 0.4) for the solar to 2.3 (Â± 0.6) for the SO4 perturbations, with minimum amplification in the summer for all drivers. The vertical and seasonal temperature response patterns indicate that the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> is warmed through similar mechanisms for all climate drivers except BC. For all drivers, the precipitation change per degree global temperature change is positive in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, with a seasonality following that of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification. We find indications that SO4 perturbations produce a slightly stronger precipitation response than the other drivers, particularly compared to CO2.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. A review of surface temperature differences is presented with a particular focus on differences in contemporary reanalyses. An important consideration is the significant differences in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> surfaces, including the central <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and non-glaciated land. While there is significant correlation among reanalyses in annual time series, there is substantial disagreement in mean values. For the period 1980-2013, the trend in annual temperature ranges from 0.3 to 0.7K per decade. Over the central <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean, differences in mean values and trends are larger. Most of the uncertainty is associated with winter months. This is likely associated with the constraint imposed by melting processes (i.e. 0 deg. Celsius), rather than seasonal changes to the observing system.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20170011215 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Presentation </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-53\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Cullather, Richard  <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Maryland Univ.

As most <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> following the isentropic surfaces.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

Nevertheless, differences among reanalyses in fundamental meteorological variables including surface air temperature are large. For example, the 1980-2009 mean surface air temperature for the north polar cap (70ÂdegN-90ÂdegN) among global reanalyses span a range of 2.4 K, which approximates the average warming trend from these reanalyses over the 30-year period of 2.1 K. Understanding these differences requires evaluation over the three principal surface domains of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>: glaciated land, the unglaciated terrestrial surface, and sea ice/ocean. An examination is conducted of contemporary global reanalyses of the ECMWF Interim project, NASA MERRA, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and NOAA CFSR using available in situ data and assessments of the surface energy budget. Overly-simplistic representations of the Greenland Ice Sheet surface are found to be associated with local warm air temperature biases in winter. A review of progress made in the development of the MERRA-2 land-ice representation is presented. Large uncertainty is also found in temperatures over the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> tundra and boreal forest zone. But a key focus of temperature differences for northern high latitudes is the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean. Near-surface air temperature differences over the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean are found to be related to discrepancies in sea ice and sea surface temperature boundary data, which are severely compromised in current reanalyses. Issues with the modeled representation of sea ice cover are an additional factor in reanalysis temperature trends. Differences in the representation of the surface energy budget among the various reanalyses are also reviewed.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20170012176 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Presentation </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-82\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Cullather, Richard  <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Maryland Univ.

While surface-based amplification of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> warming in response to increased CO2 has been established. The driving mechanisms, relevant processes, and the relative roles of local and remote mechanisms to <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Amplification remain unclear. Research over the last decade has made it clear that coupling between the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean play a key role in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Amplification. This presentation summarizes recent research on the fundamental role that atmosphere-sea ice-ocean interactions and energy exchanges play in driving <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Amplification, how these interactions manifest as radiative climate feedbacks, and how these processes influence the differences in the projected <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> climate change across CMIP5 and 6. We hypothesize that models that simulate larger warming do so by generating a larger local atmospheric circulation response that more effectively redistributes energy drawn from the ocean in sea ice retreat regions <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>-wide and contributing to a larger increase in downwelling long wave radiation. This process is also fundamentally tied to the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> lapse rate feedback.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20205010055 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Presentation </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-89\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Patrick C.

The ABoVE Benchmarking System (ABS) is an operational software package to evaluate terrestrial biosphere models against key indicators of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> and Boreal ecosystem dynamics, i.e.: carbon biogeochemistry, vegetation, permafrost, hydrology, and disturbance. The ABS utilizes satellite remote sensing data, airborne data, and field data from ABoVE as well as collaborating research networks in the region, e.g.: the Permafrost Carbon Network, the International Soil Carbon Network, the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database, AmeriFlux sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The ABS is designed to be interactive for researchers interested in having their models accurately represent observations of key <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> indicators: a user submits model results to the system, the system evaluates the model results against a set of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>-Boreal benchmarks outlined in the ABoVE Concise Experiment Plan, and the user then receives a quantitative scoring of model strengths and deficiencies through a web interface. This interactivity allows model developers to iteratively improve their model for the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>-Boreal Region by evaluating results from successive model versions. We show here, for illustration, the improvement of the Lund–Potsdam–Jena-Wald Schnee und Landschaft (LPJwsl) version model through the ABoVE ABS as a new permafrost module is coupled to the existing model framework. The ABS will continue to incorporate new benchmarks that address indicators of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>-Boreal ecosystem dynamics as they become available.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed‐phase clouds, particularly in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

Here, we apply aerosol deposition fields from 25 models contributing to two phases of the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project to simulate and evaluate within-snow BC concentrations and radiative effect in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. We accomplish this by driving the offline land and sea ice components of the Community Earth System Model with different deposition fields and meteorological conditions from 2004 to 2009, during which an extensive field campaign of BC measurements in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> snow occurred. We find that models generally underestimate BC concentrations in snow in northern Russia and Norway, while overestimating BC amounts elsewhere in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. Although simulated BC distributions in snow are poorly correlated with measurements, mean values are reasonable. The multi-model mean (range) bias in BC concentrations, sampled over the same grid cells, snow depths, and months of measurements, are −4.4 (−13.2 to +10.7) ng/g for an earlier phase of AeroCom models (phase I), and +4.1 (−13.0 to +21.4) ng/g for a more recent phase of AeroCom models (phase II), compared to the observational mean of 19.2 ng/g. Factors determining model BC concentrations in <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> snow include <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> BC emissions, transport of extra-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> aerosols, precipitation, deposition efficiency of aerosols within the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, and meltwater removal of particles in snow. Sensitivity studies show that the model-measurement evaluation is only weakly affected by meltwater scavenging efficiency because most measurements were conducted in non-melting snow. The <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> (60-90degN) atmospheric residence time for BC in phase II models ranges from 3.7 to 23.2 days, implying large inter-model variation in local BC deposition efficiency. Combined with the fact that most <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> BC deposition originates from extra-<em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> emissions, these results suggest that aerosol removal processes are a leading source of variation in model performance. The multi-model mean (full range) of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> radiative effect from BC in snow is 0.15 (0.07-0.25) W/sq m and 0.18 (0.06-0.28) W/sq m in phase I and phase II models, respectively. After correcting for model biases relative to observed BC concentrations in different regions of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>, we obtain a multi-model mean <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> radiative effect of 0.17 W/sq m for the combined AeroCom ensembles. Finally, there is a high correlation between modeled BC concentrations sampled over the observational sites and the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> as a whole, indicating that the field campaign provided a reasonable sample of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20140017663 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Reprint (Version printed in journal) </div></div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">External Source(s)</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><!-- --><a _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014\" target=\"_blank\">doi:10.5194/acp-14-2399-2014</a><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><!-- --></div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-109\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Jiao, C. <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Michigan Univ.

First, these data were used to derive two independent mean sea surface (MSS) models by stacking and averaging along-track SSH profiles gathered between 2003 and 2009. The ICESat and Envisat MSS data were combined to construct the high-resolution ICEn MSS. Second, we estimate the 5.5-year mean dynamic topography (MDT) of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean by differencing the ICEn MSS with the new GOCO02S geoid model, derived from GRACE and GOCE gravity. Using these satellite-only data we map the major features of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> Ocean dynamical height that are consistent with in situ observations, including the topographical highs and lows of the Beaufort and Greenland Gyres, respectively. Smaller-scale MDT structures remain largely unresolved due to uncertainties in the geoid at short wavelengths.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20140006607 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Reprint (Version printed in journal) </div></div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">External Source(s)</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><!-- --><a _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1029/2011GL050052\" target=\"_blank\">doi:10.1029/2011GL050052</a><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- --></div><!-- --></div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-119\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Farrell, Sinead Louise <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Maryland Univ.

Although seasonal changes in the total fraction of midlatitude air are small, there are dramatic changes in where that air last contacted the PBL, especially above 700 mb. Specifically, during winter air in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> originates preferentially over the oceans, approx. 26% in the East Pacific, and approx. 20% in the Atlantic PBL. By comparison, during summer air in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> last contacted the midlatitude PBL primarily over land, overwhelmingly so in Asia (approx. 40 %) and, to a lesser extent, in North America (approx. 24%). Seasonal changes in air-mass origin are interpreted in terms of seasonal variations in the large-scale ventilation of the midlatitude boundary layer and lower troposphere, namely changes in the midlatitude tropospheric jet and associated transient eddies during winter and large scale convective motions over midlatitudes during summer.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

In support of the assessment, we used the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Sciences (GISS) Earth System Model (modelE2.1), with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea-ice fraction, to simulate SLCF concentrations globally between 1995 and 2015. Two simulations were conducted, using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) and the Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state (MATRIX) aerosol modules. OMA is a mass-based scheme in which aerosols are assumed to remain externally mixed and have a prescribed and constant size distribution, while MATRIX is an aerosol microphysics scheme based on the quadrature method of moments, which is able to explicitly simulate the mixing state of aerosols. Anthropogenic emissions from the ECLIPSE v6b emissions database were used, along with emissions from aircrafts and open biomass burning from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), while the natural emissions of sea salt, DMS, isoprene and dust are calculated interactively. The simulated monthly surface concentrations of sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OA), and ozone (O3) are compared with observations from a set of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> stations, extracted from the EBAS and IMPROVE databases, as well as a few additional locations. Simulated aerosol optical depths (AOD) are also compared with Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The study will present the evaluation of the modelE2.1 in simulating SLCF levels over the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> using different aerosol schemes, along with observed and simulated trends of SLCFs over the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> between 1995 and 2015.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20205004491 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Presentation </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-138\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> U.

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to &gt;2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

CARVE bridges critical gaps in our knowledge and understanding of <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> ecosystems, linkages between the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> hydrologic and terrestrial carbon cycles, and the feedbacks from fires and thawing permafrost. CARVE's objectives are to: (1) Directly test hypotheses attributing the mobilization of vulnerable <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> carbon reservoirs to climate warming; (2) Deliver the first direct measurements and detailed maps of CO2 and CH4 sources on regional scales in the Alaskan <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>; and (3) Demonstrate new remote sensing and modeling capabilities to quantify feedbacks between carbon fluxes and carbon cycle-climate processes in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> (Figure 1).

Here, we analyse <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> warming in an ensemble of 16 simulations of the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP), derived from the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2).\n",
       " \n",
       " The PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> (60–90∘ N) annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) increases of 3.7 to 11.6 ∘C compared to the pre-industrial period, with a multi-model mean (MMM) increase of 7.2 ∘C. The <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> warming amplification ratio relative to global SAT anomalies in the ensemble ranges from 1.8 to 3.1 (MMM is 2.3). Sea ice extent anomalies range from −3.0 to −10.4×106\n",
       "  km2, with a MMM anomaly of −5.6×106 km2, which constitutes a decrease of 53 % compared to the pre-industrial period. The majority (11 out of 16) of models simulate summer sea-ice-free conditions (≤1×106 km2) in their mPWP simulation. The ensemble tends to underestimate SAT in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> when compared to available reconstructions, although the degree of underestimation varies strongly between the simulations. The simulations with the highest <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> SAT anomalies tend to match the proxy dataset in its current form better. The ensemble shows some agreement with reconstructions of sea ice, particularly with regard to seasonal sea ice. Large uncertainties limit the confidence that can be placed in the findings and the compatibility of the different proxy datasets. We show that while reducing uncertainties in the reconstructions could decrease the SAT data–model discord substantially, further improvements are likely to be found in enhanced boundary conditions or model physics. Lastly, we compare the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> warming in the mPWP to projections of future <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> warming and find that the PlioMIP2 ensemble simulates greater <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> amplification than CMIP5 future climate simulations and an increase instead of a decrease in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength compared to pre-industrial period. The results highlight the importance of slow feedbacks in equilibrium climate simulations, and that caution must be taken when using simulations of the mPWP as an analogue for future climate change.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row;

However, the interactions between smoke particles and clouds remain poorly quantified due to confounding meteorological influences and remote sensing limitations. Here, we use data from several aircraft campaigns in the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> and subarctic to explore cloud microphysics in liquid-phase clouds influenced by biomass burning. Median cloud droplet radii in smoky clouds were 50 smaller than in background clouds. Based on the relationship between cloud droplet number (N(liq))/ and various biomass burning tracers (BBt/ across the multi-campaign dataset, we calculated the magnitude of subarctic and <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em> smoke aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI, where ACI = (1/3) x dln(N(liq))/dln(BBt)) to be 0.12 out of a maximum possible value of 0.33 that would be obtained if all aerosols were to nucleate cloud droplets. Interestingly, in a separate subarctic case study with low liquid water content (0.02 gm/ cu m) and very high aerosol concentrations (2000-3000 cu m) in the most polluted clouds, the estimated ACI value was only 0.06. In this case, competition for water vapor by the high concentration of CCN strongly limited the formation of droplets and reduced the cloud albedo effect, which highlights the importance of cloud feedbacks across scales. Using our calculated ACI values, we estimate that the smoke-driven cloud albedo effect may decrease shortwave radiative flux by 2 and 4 W/sq or more under some low and homogeneous cloud cover conditions in the subarctic, although the changes should be smaller in high surface albedo regions of the <em class=\"hlt1\">Arctic</em>. We lastly show evidence to suggest that numerous northern latitude background Aitken particles can interact with combustion particles, perhaps impacting their properties as cloud condensation and ice nuclei. However, the influence of background particles on smoke-driven indirect effects is currently unclear.</mat-card-subtitle><!-- --><mat-card-content _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"mat-card-content details-container\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document ID</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> 20160003310 </div></div><!-- --><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Document Type</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"> Presentation </div></div><!-- --><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"detail-row ng-star-inserted\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"label\" fxflex=\"20\" style=\"margin-right: 20px; flex: 1 1 100%; box-sizing: border-box; max-width: 20%;\">Authors</div><div _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"data line-clamp\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\"><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-186\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Zamora, Lauren  <!-- --></mat-chip><span _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\"><em _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" class=\"ng-star-inserted\" fxflex=\"\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0%; box-sizing: border-box;\">(Oak Ridge Associated Universities Greenbelt, MD, United States)</em><!-- --></span></div></mat-chip-list><mat-chip-list _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" aria-invalid=\"false\" aria-multiselectable=\"false\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\" aria-required=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip-list ng-star-inserted\" id=\"mat-chip-list-187\" role=\"listbox\" tabindex=\"0\"><div class=\"mat-chip-list-wrapper\"><mat-chip _ngcontent-serverapp-c104=\"\" aria-disabled=\"false\" class=\"mat-chip mat-focus-indicator mat-primary mat-standard-chip\" fxlayout=\"\" fxlayoutgap=\"20px\" role=\"option\" style=\"flex-direction: row; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><div class=\"mat-chip-ripple\"></div> Kahn, R.
